### 📦 Core Modules

- **data_fetcher.py**: Handles real-time market data collection
- **database.py**: Manages data storage and retrieval operations
- **exchange.py**: Implements exchange connectivity and interactions
- **models.py**: Defines data models and structures

### 🧮 Feature Engineering & ML Pipeline

The feature engineering and machine learning pipeline provides powerful tools for analyzing and predicting market movements:

#### 📊 Feature Engineering (`src/features/`)
- Technical indicators (EMA, SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Rolling window statistics
- Feature caching and management
- Extensible FeatureStore system

```python
from features.feature_engineering import FeatureStore

# Initialize feature store
feature_store = FeatureStore(cache_dir='feature_cache')

# Compute technical indicators
features = feature_store.compute_technical_indicators(
    price_data,
    windows=[12, 26, 50, 200]
)
```

#### 🤖 Model Training (`src/models/`)
- Support for multiple ML models (RandomForest, XGBoost)
- Model training and evaluation
- Cross-validation capabilities
- Model persistence and loading

```python
from models.basic_models import ModelTrainer

# Initialize and train model
trainer = ModelTrainer(
    model_type='xgboost',
    task='regression'
)
metrics = trainer.train(features, target)
```

#### 📈 Example Usage
Check out `src/examples/demo_feature_engineering.py` for a complete demonstration of:
- Loading historical data
- Computing technical indicators
- Training and evaluating ML models
- Visualizing results and feature importance

## 📝 Usage

```python
from src.data_pipeline import DataFetcher, Exchange, Database
from src.features import FeatureStore
from src.models import ModelTrainer

# Initialize components
fetcher = DataFetcher()
exchange = Exchange()
db = Database()
feature_store = FeatureStore()

# Start data collection
fetcher.start()

# Compute features and train model
features = feature_store.compute_technical_indicators(price_data)
trainer = ModelTrainer()
trainer.train(features, target)
```
