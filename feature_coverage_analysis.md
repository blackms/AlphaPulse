   - Fixed with patch in `patch_portfolio_data.py`

2. **Async Execution Issue**:
   - Error in portfolio rebalancing: `'coroutine' object is not callable`
   - Root cause: Improper awaiting of coroutine in `_fetch_historical_data`
   - Solution requires updating the `_retry_with_timeout` method

3. **Frontend Type Definitions**:
   - Multiple TypeScript errors in UI components
   - Missing type definitions for API response structures
   - Requires updating interface definitions in dashboard code

## Conclusion

The AI Hedge Fund system has successfully implemented all core components described in the documentation. Identified issues primarily relate to integration between components rather than missing features. The patch scripts address these issues while maintaining the architecture defined in the documentation.
