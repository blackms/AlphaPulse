# Exchange Data Caching Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement
- Portfolio API is slow because it fetches exchange data on every request
- "No order history found" warnings appear despite orders being present

## Solution Components

### 1. Background Data Synchronization
- Leverage the existing `ExchangeDataSynchronizer` which already runs every hour
- Ensure it properly caches exchange data in the database
- Validate all data types are being properly synced (balances, positions, orders, prices)

### 2. API Refactor
- Modify the portfolio API to prioritize cached data
- Add checks for cache freshness (< 1 hour old)
- Implement asynchronous cache refresh on cache miss

### 3. Force Reload Endpoint
- Leverage the existing reload_data method in the PortfolioDataAccessor
- Ensure it properly triggers the synchronizer

### 4. Fix Order History Bug
- Investigate ccxt_adapter.py:get_average_entry_price around line 331
- Fix the bug causing "No order history found for BTC/USDT" warnings
- Add better error handling for edge cases

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. Background task fetches exchange data hourly
2. Data is persisted in the database 
3. API reads from the database instead of the exchange
4. Forced reload triggers immediate data refresh

### Database Schema
- Using existing ExchangeCacheRepository tables:
  - exchange_sync_status: Tracks sync status for each data type
  - exchange_balances: Stores user wallet balances
  - exchange_positions: Stores user positions
  - exchange_orders: Stores order history
  - exchange_prices: Stores asset prices

### Testing Plan
1. Test background sync functionality
2. Test API read from cache
3. Test forced reload
4. Test order history bug fix

## Expected Performance Improvements
- Portfolio API response time should reduce significantly (expected >10x speedup)
- System resource usage should decrease due to fewer direct exchange API calls
- System reliability should improve by reducing dependency on external exchange APIs

## Metrics to Validate Success
1. API response time before/after implementation
2. Cache hit rate
3. Elimination of order history warnings
