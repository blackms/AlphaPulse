ci_cd_status:
  pipeline_health: "FIXED"
  last_fixed: "2025-07-06"
  status: "GitHub Actions pipeline fully operational"
  fixes_applied:
    - "Updated Python version constraint to support 3.12"
    - "Added PostgreSQL and Redis services to CI"
    - "Configured proper environment variables for testing"
    - "Added system dependencies (build-essential, libpq-dev, etc.)"
    - "Created basic import tests for CI validation"
    - "Added timeout handling to prevent hanging tests"
    - "Improved pytest configuration with proper test discovery"
  test_strategy: "Basic import tests first, then additional verification"
  
key_reminders:
  - "Many sophisticated features exist but aren't used"
  - "Always check if feature already exists before implementing"
  - "Integration is more valuable than new features"
  - "Update these docs after any integration work"
  - "Read COMPONENT_MAP.yaml for detailed integration status"
