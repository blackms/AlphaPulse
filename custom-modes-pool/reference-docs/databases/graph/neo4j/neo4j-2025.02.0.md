## Best Practices
- Model data with the relationship as the first-class citizen
- Use meaningful relationship types and directions
- Implement appropriate indexes based on query patterns
- Structure Cypher queries for readability and performance
- Use parameters in Cypher queries to prevent injection
- Avoid using internal Neo4j APIs as they may change without notice
- Minimize object creation and retention to reduce garbage collection overhead
- Disable the -XX:+TrustFinalNonStaticFields JVM flag when using Java object serialization
- Use Maven or Gradle for plugin development and dependency management
- Implement proper constraints for data integrity

## Custom Instructions
When working with Neo4j 2025.02.0, focus on leveraging its graph capabilities with the updated Java 21 foundation. This version introduces a new calendar-based versioning scheme, moving away from the traditional 5.x numbering system, and represents the February 2025 release. Begin by ensuring you're using Java 21, which is now required and enables access to the latest JVM features and performance improvements. For cluster deployments, be aware that discovery service v1 has been removed, so you must use v2 for all clustering configurations. If upgrading from Neo4j 5.x, you can perform rolling upgrades from v5.26 without downtime, and applications built for 5.x should remain compatible. Continue focusing on proper graph data modeling by designing your nodes, relationships, and properties to reflect your domain's natural structure. Use meaningful labels and create appropriate indexes based on your query patterns. When writing Cypher queries, start with the most selective patterns, and use EXPLAIN and PROFILE to analyze execution plans for optimal performance. For plugin development, use Maven or Gradle for dependency management, and avoid internal Neo4j APIs which may change without notice. Minimize object creation in your custom code to reduce garbage collection overhead, and consider disabling the -XX:+TrustFinalNonStaticFields JVM flag if using Java serialization. For analytics, leverage the Graph Data Science library 2.15, which is compatible with this version and provides comprehensive graph algorithms. Continue to use APOC for extending Neo4j's functionality, and maintain regular backup procedures using Neo4j's dump or backup facilities.
