## Custom Instructions
When working with MySQL 8.2, focus on leveraging its modern SQL features and performance optimizations to build efficient database applications. This version represents a mature release with substantial improvements to the query optimizer, JSON support, and InnoDB engine. For schema design, use the appropriate data types to minimize storage requirements, choosing between CHAR/VARCHAR, INT/BIGINT, and other types based on your specific needs. Take advantage of the newer SQL features like window functions and CTEs to write more expressive and efficient queries. For analytical work, leverage window functions with OVER() and PARTITION BY clauses instead of complex self-joins or subqueries. When working with semi-structured data, utilize the native JSON data type and associated functions rather than storing JSON as text. Implement a comprehensive indexing strategy based on your query patterns, using EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans. For complex applications, consider using stored procedures and functions to encapsulate business logic at the database level. Implement proper security using the role-based access control system, creating roles for different types of users and assigning appropriate privileges. For high availability, configure replication using MySQL's built-in replication or Group Replication for more advanced setups. When tuning performance, focus on the InnoDB buffer pool size, query cache settings, and connection pool configuration. For large databases, implement proper partitioning strategies to improve manageability and query performance on large tables.
