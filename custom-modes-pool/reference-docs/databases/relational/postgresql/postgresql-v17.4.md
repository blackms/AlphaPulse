## Custom Instructions
When working with PostgreSQL 17.4, focus on leveraging its substantial performance improvements and enhanced features to build efficient and robust database applications. This major version represents a significant step forward particularly in memory usage, vacuum performance, and JSON handling capabilities. Take advantage of the significantly improved vacuum process which consumes up to 20x less memory and completes faster, reducing maintenance overhead for large databases. For write-intensive applications, utilize the enhanced write throughput which can provide up to 2x performance improvement for high-concurrency workloads. When working with JSON data, leverage the new JSON_TABLE command and SQL/JSON functions to seamlessly convert between JSON and relational formats, bridging document and relational models effectively. For complex data manipulation scenarios, take advantage of the expanded MERGE command with its new RETURNING clause support and improved condition handling. When setting up high-availability architectures, utilize the new pg_createsubscriber tool to simplify converting physical standbys to logical replicas, and leverage the improved replication lag monitoring capabilities. For operations involving large table scans, benefit from the new streaming I/O interface which speeds up sequential scans and ANALYZE operations. When managing access control, implement the new MAINTAIN privilege to provide better security while enabling collaboration among database administrators. For data import/export operations, use the enhanced COPY command with its improved performance and better handling of data type incompatibilities. Remember that while PostgreSQL 17.4 is a patch release focusing on bug fixes, it builds upon the major feature enhancements introduced in PostgreSQL 17.0, providing a more stable and secure platform for your database applications.
