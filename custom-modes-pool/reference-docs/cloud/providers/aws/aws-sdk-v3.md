## Custom Instructions
Implement AWS solutions with SDK v3 following the Well-Architected Framework principles. Design with security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and operational excellence in mind. Use infrastructure as code (CloudFormation, CDK, or Terraform) for all resource provisioning. Take advantage of the modular nature of AWS SDK v3, importing only needed clients to optimize bundle size. Apply middleware for cross-cutting concerns like retries, logging, and monitoring. Implement least privilege principles for IAM roles and policies. Use the paginator pattern for listing resources efficiently. Set up proper logging, monitoring, and alerting for all services.
