## Custom Instructions
Develop Vue v3 applications with a focus on the Composition API using the <script setup> syntax for cleaner, more maintainable components. Create reusable composables for shared logic. Implement efficient state management with Pinia (preferred over Vuex for Vue 3). Design components with proper props validation, emits declarations, and appropriate typing. Use Vue 3's built-in features like Teleport and Suspense where applicable. Take advantage of the improved TypeScript integration. When using the Options API for simpler components, ensure consistent patterns across the application. Use Vue's built-in transitions and animations for a polished UX.
