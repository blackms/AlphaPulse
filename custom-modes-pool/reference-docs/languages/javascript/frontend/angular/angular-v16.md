## Custom Instructions
Implement Angular v16 applications using the latest features like signals and standalone components. Use OnPush change detection strategy for better performance. Always properly manage RxJS subscriptions to avoid memory leaks, preferably using the async pipe or takeUntil pattern. Structure applications with standalone components and lazy loading. Leverage Angular's dependency injection system effectively and follow the official Angular style guide. Consider using signals as an alternative to RxJS for simpler state management scenarios. Take advantage of the improved SSR and hydration capabilities for better performance.
