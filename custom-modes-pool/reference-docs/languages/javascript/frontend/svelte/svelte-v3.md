## Custom Instructions
Develop Svelte v3 applications with a focus on its unique reactivity system and compiler-based approach. Leverage Svelte's component-scoped CSS and built-in animation system. Use reactive statements ($:) for derived values and computations. Implement efficient state management with Svelte stores, using custom stores for complex state. Create reusable actions for DOM node manipulation. Organize components using logical separation of concerns. Structure SvelteKit applications with proper routing and data loading patterns. Use TypeScript for type safety when appropriate. Take advantage of Svelte's compile-time approach for optimal runtime performance.
