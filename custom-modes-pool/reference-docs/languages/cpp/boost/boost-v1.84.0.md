## Custom Instructions
When working with Boost 1.84.0, focus on leveraging its comprehensive suite of C++ libraries to solve complex programming challenges with well-tested, portable code. Boost serves as both a complement to the C++ Standard Library and a testbed for features that may eventually become standardized. For memory management, prefer Boost's smart pointer implementations (now largely superseded by std equivalents in modern C++) for legacy code or when you need specialized behavior like intrusive_ptr. For networking and asynchronous I/O, utilize Boost.Asio's powerful abstractions for event-driven programming, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous paradigms. When dealing with complex data structures, consider Boost.MultiIndex for maintaining multiple indices over the same dataset, and Boost.Bimap for bidirectional maps. For metaprogramming tasks, leverage Boost.MPL, Boost.Fusion, and Boost.Hana to write highly generic code with strong type safety. Take advantage of Boost.Filesystem for portable path manipulation and file operations (though consider std::filesystem in C++17 and later). When implementing concurrent code, use the appropriate Boost threading abstractions and synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables. For parsing and text processing, consider Boost.Spirit for complex grammar definitions and Boost.Regex for regular expressions. When handling errors, leverage Boost.Exception for richer exception handling with stacktraces and additional context information. Finally, implement comprehensive testing with Boost.Test, taking advantage of its test fixtures, parameterized testing, and detailed reporting capabilities.
