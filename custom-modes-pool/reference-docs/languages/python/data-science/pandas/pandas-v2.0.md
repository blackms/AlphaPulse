## Custom Instructions
Analyze data using Pandas v2.0+ with a focus on its enhanced performance features and Arrow integration. Apply vectorized operations rather than loops for performance. Use PyArrow-backed data types for memory efficiency and interoperability. Leverage copy-on-write semantics to avoid unnecessary copies. Implement proper data cleaning techniques including handling missing values, outliers, and data type conversions. Use method chaining with the new API style for readable data transformations. Create informative visualizations that clearly communicate data insights. Document your analysis process and findings clearly.
