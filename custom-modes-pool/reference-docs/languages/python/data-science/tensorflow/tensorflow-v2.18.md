## Custom Instructions
Develop machine learning solutions with TensorFlow 2.18 focusing on the updated NumPy 2.0 integration. Be aware of potential changes in numerical precision and type handling when migrating existing code. For edge deployment, transition from TensorFlow Lite to LiteRT according to the new repository structure. Implement efficient data pipelines using the enhanced tf.data API features, particularly the new optimization parameters for the map() function. Utilize Hermetic CUDA for more reproducible builds when working with GPU acceleration. When working with model optimization, leverage the expanded quantization support including INT4 and INT16 tensor types. Always validate models across different precision levels to ensure consistent behavior. Design your ML pipelines with TFX for production-grade workflows. For large-scale distributed training, properly manage GPU resources and implement memory-efficient strategies. Stay updated with the ongoing transition to Keras 3.0 and ensure compatibility with your existing models and workflows.
