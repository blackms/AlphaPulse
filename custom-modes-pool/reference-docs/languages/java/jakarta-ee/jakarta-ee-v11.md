## Custom Instructions
When working with Jakarta EE 11, focus on leveraging its modern enterprise capabilities particularly the new Jakarta Data 1.0 specification which standardizes data access across relational and NoSQL databases. Take advantage of Java SE 21 features, especially virtual threads and records, which are now supported across the platform. For data access, use the repository pattern provided by Jakarta Data, which offers automatic query methods, JDQL, and built-in repository types that significantly reduce boilerplate code. Build your application using CDI as the foundational dependency injection mechanism, ensuring loose coupling between components. For web applications, utilize Jakarta Faces for component-based UIs or Jakarta REST for building RESTful services. Implement proper validation using Jakarta Bean Validation for ensuring data integrity throughout your application. For security implementation, use Jakarta Security with its improved JWT alignment and support for multiple authentication mechanisms. When developing asynchronous applications, leverage Jakarta Messaging with its new CDI-based @MessageListener and the lighter Jakarta Messaging Lite for cloud-native scenarios. Structure your application in a modular fashion, taking advantage of the removal of umbrella JARs which provides more flexibility in API usage. Ensure proper testing using the modernized Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). When deploying to production, consider Jakarta EE-compatible application servers like Payara, WildFly, or OpenLiberty, which will be updated to support Jakarta EE 11.
