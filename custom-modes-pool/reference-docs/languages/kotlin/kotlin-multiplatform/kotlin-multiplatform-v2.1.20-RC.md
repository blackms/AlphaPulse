## Custom Instructions
When working with Kotlin Multiplatform 2.1.20-RC, focus on leveraging its key strengths: code sharing between platforms while maintaining access to platform-specific APIs. This version introduces important improvements for concurrent programming with the new common atomic types in the kotlin.concurrent.atomics package, allowing you to write thread-safe code once and deploy it across platforms. Take advantage of the improved UUID parsing and formatting functions which now support both hex-and-dash and plain hexadecimal formats through the new parseHexDash() and toHexDashString() methods. When setting up your build system, explore the new DSL that replaces Gradle's Application plugin, providing a more Kotlin-centric approach to configuring your applications. Structure your multiplatform projects with a clear separation between common code and platform-specific implementations using the expect/actual pattern. For asynchronous programming, utilize kotlinx.coroutines which works seamlessly across platforms. When implementing platform-specific features, keep the interface in the common code and only implement the necessary platform details in the actual implementations. For persistence, consider cross-platform solutions like SQLDelight, and for networking, use Ktor which provides a consistent API across platforms. Remember that since this is a release candidate (RC), you should be prepared for potential changes before the final release and report any issues you encounter to help improve the final version. Also note that the K2 implementation of the kapt compiler plugin is now enabled by default, which should provide performance improvements but might require some adjustments if you were previously using the older implementation.
