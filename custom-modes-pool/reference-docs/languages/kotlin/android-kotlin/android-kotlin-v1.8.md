Develop Android applications using Kotlin v1.8+ with a focus on Google's Material Design guidelines and modern Android development practices. Implement Jetpack Compose for modern, declarative UIs where appropriate. Apply Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData/StateFlow, Room) following the MVVM pattern for clean separation of concerns. Use Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations and reactive programming. Implement dependency injection with Hilt or Koin. Create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Optimize application performance with proper resource usage and lifecycle management. Follow proper permissions handling and security best practices. Consider backward compatibility with appropriate AndroidX libraries.
