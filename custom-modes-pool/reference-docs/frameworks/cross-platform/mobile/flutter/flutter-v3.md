## Custom Instructions
Develop Flutter v3.x applications using Dart 3 features and best practices. Structure your code with a clear separation of UI, business logic, and data layers using a state management solution appropriate to your app's complexity (Provider for simple cases, Bloc/Riverpod for more complex ones). Implement adaptive UI that works well across mobile, web, and desktop platforms. Use Flutter's widget system effectively, creating reusable components. Apply proper error handling and responsive design patterns. Optimize rendering performance with efficient widget structures and judicious use of StatefulWidgets. Take advantage of Material 3 design components when appropriate.
