## Custom Instructions
Develop React Native v0.70+ applications with a focus on the new architecture when possible (check if a project has enabled Fabric and TurboModules). Use functional components and hooks with clean component structures. Implement proper navigation patterns using React Navigation v6. Apply efficient state management solutions appropriate to app complexity. Consider platform-specific behaviors and implement proper error boundaries. Use Hermes engine for improved performance and lower memory footprint. Utilize React Native's performance optimization techniques like memoization and proper list rendering. Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android platforms. Consider migrating to the new architecture for performance-critical components.
