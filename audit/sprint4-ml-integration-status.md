# ML Feature Integration Status (deprecated)

The prior sprint-tracking content in this file no longer reflects the codebase.
Key references for the current state are:

- `docs/ensemble-methods.md`
- `docs/ONLINE_LEARNING.md`
- `docs/gpu_acceleration.md`
- `docs/regime-detection.md`

Each module README in `src/alpha_pulse/ml/` provides implementation details and
integration notes.  Create a fresh audit if you need time-boxed reporting.

### 5. Explainable AI ‚ùå NOT INTEGRATED (0%)
**Status**: Complete XAI implementation but zero integration
- **Implemented**:
  - SHAP explainer
  - LIME explainer
  - Feature importance analysis
  - Decision tree visualization
  - ExplainabilityService
- **Missing**:
  - Service initialization in API
  - REST endpoints for explanations
  - Dashboard integration
  - Real-time prediction explanations

## Integration Requirements

### Online Learning Integration TODO:
1. Create OnlineLearningService initialization in main.py
2. Create REST router for online learning endpoints
3. Wire service to agent predictions for real-time updates
4. Add model versioning and rollback capabilities
5. Create monitoring for model drift

### GPU Acceleration Integration TODO:
1. Initialize GPUService in main.py startup
2. Create GPU management REST endpoints
3. Integrate with ensemble training pipelines
4. Add GPU metrics to monitoring system
5. Create resource allocation policies

### Explainable AI Integration TODO:
1. Initialize ExplainabilityService in main.py
2. Create explainability REST router
3. Wire to agent predictions for real-time explanations
4. Create dashboard components for visualizations
5. Add explanation storage for audit trail

## Risk Assessment

**Current State**: While ensemble methods and regime detection are now fully integrated, significant ML capabilities remain dark:

1. **Online Learning** - System cannot adapt to changing market conditions
2. **GPU Acceleration** - Training is CPU-bound, limiting model complexity
3. **Explainable AI** - No visibility into why trades are recommended

**Business Impact**: 
- Reduced adaptability to market changes
- Slower model training and optimization
- Limited trust and transparency in AI decisions
- Regulatory compliance challenges without explainability

## Recommended Priority

1. **Explainable AI** (HIGH) - Critical for trust and compliance
2. **Online Learning** (HIGH) - Essential for adaptation
3. **GPU Acceleration** (MEDIUM) - Performance optimization

## Estimated Integration Effort

- Online Learning: 2-3 hours
- GPU Acceleration: 3-4 hours
- Explainable AI: 2-3 hours

Total: 7-10 hours to achieve 100% Sprint 4 ML integration
