5. Create monitoring for model drift

### GPU Acceleration Integration TODO:
1. Initialize GPUService in main.py startup
2. Create GPU management REST endpoints
3. Integrate with ensemble training pipelines
4. Add GPU metrics to monitoring system
5. Create resource allocation policies

### Explainable AI Integration TODO:

3. Wire to agent predictions for real-time explanations
4. Create dashboard components for visualizations
5. Add explanation storage for audit trail

## Risk Assessment

**Current State**: While ensemble methods and regime detection are now fully integrated, significant ML capabilities remain dark:

1. **Online Learning** - System cannot adapt to changing market conditions
2. **GPU Acceleration** - Training is CPU-bound, limiting model complexity
3. **Explainable AI** - No visibility into why trades are recommended

**Business Impact**: 
- Reduced adaptability to market changes
- Slower model training and optimization
- Limited trust and transparency in AI decisions
- Regulatory compliance challenges without explainability

## Recommended Priority

1. **Explainable AI** (HIGH) - Critical for trust and compliance
2. **Online Learning** (HIGH) - Essential for adaptation
3. **GPU Acceleration** (MEDIUM) - Performance optimization

## Estimated Integration Effort

- Online Learning: 2-3 hours
- GPU Acceleration: 3-4 hours
- Explainable AI: 2-3 hours

Total: 7-10 hours to achieve 100% Sprint 4 ML integration
