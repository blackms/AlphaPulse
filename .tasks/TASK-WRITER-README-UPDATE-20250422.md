# Update Comprehensive README.md Documentation

## Objective
Update the `README.md` file in the project root directory (`/home/alessio/NeuralTrading/AlphaPulse/README.md`) to include comprehensive documentation covering various aspects of the AlphaPulse software.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The `README.md` file is updated with all the sections listed below.
- Each section contains relevant and accurate information about the AlphaPulse project.
- The documentation is formatted clearly using Markdown headings, tables, code blocks, and includes internal navigation links where appropriate.
- Prerequisites, system requirements, installation steps, configuration options, and usage examples are clearly explained.
- The API reference section is complete and includes request/response examples, parameter descriptions, and error codes (can leverage existing `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` content).
- Performance, troubleshooting, security, and contribution guidelines are included.
- A changelog and support channels are mentioned.

## Required Sections

Please include the following sections in the `README.md`:

- [ ] 1. Executive summary of the software's purpose and main benefits
- [ ] 2. Installation instructions for all supported platforms with prerequisites and system requirements
- [ ] 3. Step-by-step configuration guide with explanation of all available options and their default values
- [ ] 4. Detailed feature overview organized by functional areas with screenshots where applicable (Note: Screenshots may need user input or placeholders)
- [ ] 5. Complete API reference with request/response examples, parameter descriptions, and error codes (Refer to `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for content)
- [ ] 6. Usage examples showing common workflows and advanced patterns
- [ ] 7. Performance optimization guidelines with benchmarks and resource utilization metrics (Note: Benchmarks/metrics may need user input or placeholders)
- [ ] 8. Troubleshooting section addressing known issues with diagnostic steps and solutions
- [ ] 9. Security considerations including authentication methods, data protection, and compliance information
- [ ] 10. Contribution guidelines with code style, testing requirements, and pull request process
- [ ] 11. Changelog highlighting recent updates, improvements, and deprecated features (Refer to `CHANGELOG.md`)
- [ ] 12. Support channels and community resources

## Notes
- You may need to read other project files (e.g., configuration files, source code, `CHANGELOG.md`, `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`) to gather the necessary information for each section.
- For sections requiring information not readily available in files (e.g., specific benchmarks, detailed troubleshooting steps not yet documented), please add placeholders or note where user input is needed.
- Ensure the formatting is clean and easy to read.
