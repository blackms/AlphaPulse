# API Documentation Enhancement

## Objective
Enhance the API documentation to provide a comprehensive reference for all available endpoints in the AlphaPulse API.

## Actions Taken

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Reviewed existing API_DOCUMENTATION.md file
   - Found it was missing many endpoints and lacked detailed information

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Examined the main API file (`src/alpha_pulse/api/main.py`) to identify all included routers
   - Analyzed individual router files to understand endpoint structure and functionality:
     - `positions.py` - Endpoints for position data
     - `risk.py` - Endpoints for risk management
     - `hedging.py` - Endpoints for hedging operations
     - `portfolio.py` - Endpoints for portfolio data
     - `metrics.py` - Endpoints for metrics
   - Examined WebSocket endpoints in `websockets/endpoints.py`

3. **Documentation Creation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation covering:
     - Authentication methods (API Key and OAuth2)
     - All REST endpoints organized by category
     - WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
     - Request/response examples in JSON format
     - Configuration options
     - Error handling
     - Development instructions

## Results
- Created a detailed API documentation file that covers all available endpoints
- Added example request/response formats for better clarity
- Organized endpoints by functional category for easier navigation
- Included WebSocket documentation for real-time data access
- Added configuration and error handling sections

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more detailed examples for specific use cases
- Update documentation as new endpoints are added
- Consider generating interactive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
