# AlphaPulse System Initialization and Coordination Setup

## Task Description

Initialize the AlphaPulse system for effective coordination and prepare for future development, maintenance, and enhancement tasks.

## Objectives

- [x] Delegate project discovery and analysis
- [x] Review Stack Profile and Requirements Document
- [x] Establish coordination framework
- [ ] Identify potential next steps based on project state
- [ ] Prepare for future task delegation

## Coordination Log

### 2025-04-22 22:35:00 - Initialization Started

Received request to initialize the AlphaPulse system. Delegated discovery task to Project Onboarding mode to analyze the project structure, architecture, and requirements.

### 2025-04-22 22:40:00 - Discovery Completed

Project Onboarding mode completed the discovery process successfully. The following artifacts were created:
- Stack Profile (`.context/stack_profile.md`)
- Requirements Document (`.docs/requirements.md`)
- Discovery Task Log (`.tasks/TASK-DISC-001.md`)

### 2025-04-22 22:45:00 - Project Analysis

Reviewed the created artifacts and gained a comprehensive understanding of the AlphaPulse system:

**Key Findings:**
1. **System Purpose**: AlphaPulse is an AI-driven hedge fund system implementing a multi-agent trading architecture for backtesting the S&P 500 index.
2. **Architecture**: The system follows a multi-layered architecture with four main components:
   - Input Layer (Specialized Agents)
   - Risk Management Layer
   - Portfolio Management Layer
   - Output Layer (Trading Actions)
3. **Technology Stack**:
   - Backend: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI, PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB, Redis
   - Frontend: React with TypeScript, Material-UI
   - Data Processing: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn
   - External Integrations: FRED API, Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI, Bybit
4. **Key Components**:
   - Six specialized trading agents
   - Comprehensive risk management system
   - Multiple portfolio optimization strategies
   - RESTful API and React-based dashboard

## Next Steps

Based on the project analysis, potential next steps could include:

1. **System Health Check**: Verify the current state of the system, including database connectivity, API functionality, and dashboard operation.
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Improve API documentation and user guides as recommended in the discovery task.
3. **Testing Coverage**: Enhance test coverage for critical components like risk management and portfolio optimization.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize data processing and storage for large-scale backtesting.
5. **Security Review**: Conduct a security review, especially for API authentication and sensitive data handling.
6. **Feature Implementation**: Implement any pending features or enhancements from the requirements document.

The next specific actions will be determined based on user priorities and current project state.
