# Fix Non-Passing Alerts API Tests

## Objective
Identify and fix the issues causing tests to fail in the `src/alpha_pulse/tests/api/test_alerts_api.py` file.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests in `src/alpha_pulse/tests/api/test_alerts_api.py` pass successfully.
- The underlying cause of the test failures is addressed in the relevant code.
- No new errors or warnings are introduced.

## Task
1. Analyze the test failures in `src/alpha_pulse/tests/api/test_alerts_api.py`. You may need to run the tests to see the specific error messages and tracebacks.
2. Identify the root cause of the failures, which may involve examining the test code itself or the API code being tested (likely in `src/alpha_pulse/api/routers/alerts.py` or related modules).
3. Implement the necessary code changes to fix the issues.
4. Rerun the tests to confirm that they now pass.
5. Once all tests in the specified file are passing, report completion using `attempt_completion` and update the task status in the TOML block to "ðŸŸ£ Review".

## File to Investigate
- `src/alpha_pulse/tests/api/test_alerts_api.py`

## Notes
- You may need to read other files in the `src/alpha_pulse/api/` or `src/alpha_pulse/monitoring/alerting/` directories to understand the code being tested.
- Ensure that any changes made do not negatively impact other parts of the system.
