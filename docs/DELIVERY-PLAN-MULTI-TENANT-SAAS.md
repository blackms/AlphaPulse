### 1.2 Value Prioritisation

**Method**: MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have)

**Must Have** (MVP - Sprint 1-16):
- Database multi-tenancy (EPIC-001)
- Application multi-tenancy (EPIC-002)
- Credential management (EPIC-003)
- Caching layer (EPIC-004)
- Billing system (EPIC-005)
- Tenant provisioning (EPIC-006)
- Testing & stabilization (EPIC-008)

**Should Have** (Sprint 17-20):

## 7. Change Management

### 7.1 Feature Flags

**Flag Strategy**:
- **Feature**: `multi_tenant_enabled`
- **Purpose**: Gradual rollout of multi-tenant features
- **Implementation**: LaunchDarkly or custom (database-driven)

**Rollout Plan**:

| Sprint | Rollout % | Tenants | Notes |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| 17 | 10% | 10 beta tenants (whitelisted) | Free for 3 months, NDA signed |
| 18 | 30% | +40 early access (total 50) | 50% discount for 6 months |
| 19 | 100% | All new signups | General availability |

**Kill-Switch Logic**:
- If error rate >1% for multi-tenant features → Disable feature flag (back to single-tenant mode)
- If critical bug found → Disable feature flag, rollback database migration (if needed)
- **Decision Maker**: On-call engineer (Tech Lead if escalation needed)

**Cleanup Tasks**:
- Sprint 21 (post-launch): Remove feature flag code (once 100% rollout stable for 1 month)
- Sprint 21: Delete old single-tenant code paths

### 7.2 Data Migration

**Migration Strategy** (per MIGRATION-PROTO.yaml):
- **Approach**: Online migration (zero downtime)
- **Tool**: Custom Python scripts + Alembic (SQLAlchemy migrations)
- **Checkpoints**: Staging (Sprint 6) → Production (Sprint 7)

**Backfill Plan**:
- **Existing Customers**: Migrate 1 customer per day (manual process) starting Sprint 17
- **Data Transformation**: Add `tenant_id` to existing rows, set `tenant_id = uuid_from_email(email)`
- **Validation**: Row count comparison, spot-check 10% of records

**Validation**:
- **Pre-Migration**: Export row counts from all tables
- **Post-Migration**: Compare row counts (must match exactly)
- **Smoke Tests**: Log in as migrated customer, execute trade, verify portfolio displayed correctly

**Rollback Plan**:
- **Database**: Restore from backup (taken immediately before migration)
- **Application**: Disable feature flag `multi_tenant_enabled`
- **Time**: <30 minutes to rollback (tested in Sprint 14 rehearsal)

### 7.3 Training

**Customer Support Training**:
- **Audience**: Support team (5 people)
- **Duration**: 1 day (Sprint 16)
- **Content**:
  - How multi-tenant platform works
  - Tenant signup flow (demo)
