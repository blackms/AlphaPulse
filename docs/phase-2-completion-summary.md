---

## 3. Approval Conditions

Per architecture-review.md, 3 conditions must be met before Phase 3:

| Condition | Status | Owner | Deliverable | Due Date |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **1. Dev Environment Setup** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Tech Lead | development-environment.md (22KB) | Sprint 3 ✅ |
| **2. Load Testing Validation** | ⏳ **SPRINT 4** | Senior Backend Engineer | Load test report (p99 <500ms validation) | Sprint 4, Week 1 |
| **3. Operational Runbook** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Tech Lead + DevOps | operational-runbook.md (25KB) | Sprint 3 ✅ |

**Progress**: 2/3 complete (67%)

**Blocker**: Load testing validation (Approval Condition 2) must complete before Phase 3 implementation begins.

---

## 4. Architecture Validation

### 4.1 Design Principles

| Principle | Validation | Evidence |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Simplicity over complexity** | ✅ VALIDATED | PostgreSQL RLS (standard), Stripe billing (SaaS), Vault secrets (tool), Single RLS policy per table |
| **Evolutionary architecture** | ✅ VALIDATED | SOA (10 services), API versioning (`/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`), Alembic migrations, Feature flags, 5 extension points |
| **Data sovereignty** | ✅ VALIDATED | Services own data (no shared databases), API contracts for cross-service access, Tenant-scoped isolation (RLS, Redis namespaces, Vault policies) |
| **Observability first** | ✅ VALIDATED | Prometheus metrics defined, Structured logging (JSON, Loki), Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), 6 critical alerts |

---

### 4.2 Scalability

| Metric | Phase 1 (100 tenants) | Phase 2 (1,000 tenants) | Phase 3 (10,000 tenants) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **API Pods** | 10-50 (HPA) | 50-100 (HPA) | 100-200 (HPA) |
| **Agent Workers** | 30-120 | 120-300 | 300-600 |
| **Database** | Single master | Master + 2-3 read replicas | Sharding or CockroachDB |
| **Redis** | 6 pods (3M + 3R) | 9 pods (6M + 3R) | 12 pods (cluster mode) |
| **Cost/Month** | $2,350-3,750 | $8,000-12,000 | $30,000-50,000 |
| **p99 Latency** | <200ms (projected) | <300ms | <400ms |

**Conclusion**: Architecture scales horizontally to 1,000 tenants with minimal changes. 10,000 tenants requires database sharding or distributed SQL.

| **Data Encryption (Transit)** | TLS 1.3, Let's Encrypt certificates | ✅ Designed |
| **Data Encryption (Rest)** | PostgreSQL encryption, Vault AES-256 | ✅ Designed |
| **Tenant Isolation** | RLS policies + Redis namespaces (`tenant:{id}:*`) + Vault policies | ✅ Designed |
| **Secrets Management** | HashiCorp Vault with tenant-scoped policies | ✅ Designed |

**Risk Assessment**: 8 risks identified, 6 reduced to LOW, 2 remain MEDIUM (JWT token theft, Vault performance).

---

### 4.4 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

**Phase 1 (100 tenants)**:

| Cost Category | Monthly | Annual |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Infrastructure** | $2,350-3,750 | $28,200-45,000 |
| **Salaries (4 FTE)** | $40,000 | $480,000 |
| **Support & Training** | $2,000 | $24,000 |
| **Total** | $44,350-45,750 | $532,200-549,000 |

**Break-Even Analysis**:
- Monthly Revenue Needed: $44,350
- Starter Tier ($99): 448 customers
- Pro Tier ($499): 89 customers
- **Mixed** (70% Starter, 30% Pro): ~340 customers

**Profitability**:
- Starter Tier: $62-76 profit per customer (63-77% margin)
- Pro Tier: $462-476 profit per customer (93-95% margin)
- Enterprise Tier: Custom pricing ($2,000+), high margin
