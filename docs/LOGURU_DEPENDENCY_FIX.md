# Loguru Dependency Fix

## Issue

The CI build was failing with a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'loguru'" error. This occurred because the loguru package was being imported in the codebase but was not included in the project dependencies.

## Solution

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. Added the loguru package to the project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [tool.poetry.dependencies]
   # ... other dependencies ...
   loguru = "^0.7.0"
   ```

2. Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to verify that loguru can be imported:
   ```yaml
   # Verify the dependencies are installed
   echo "Verifying dependencies..."
   poetry run python -c "import httpx; import ccxt; import langchain_openai; import textblob; import loguru; print('All required dependencies successfully imported')"
   ```

## Implementation Details

Since the project uses Poetry for dependency management, adding the dependency to `pyproject.toml` ensures that:

1. The package is installed when running `poetry install` locally
2. The package is installed in the CI environment during the GitHub Actions workflow
3. The package is included in any generated requirements files or lock files

The GitHub Actions workflow already had a step to install dependencies using Poetry:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies with Poetry
  run: |
    echo "===== Installing Python dependencies with Poetry ====="
    poetry install --no-interaction
```

This step installs all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`, including the newly added loguru package.

## Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Adding loguru to the import verification step in the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Running the CI build to ensure it completes without loguru-related errors
