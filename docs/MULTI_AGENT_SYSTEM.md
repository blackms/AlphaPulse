## Domain & Business Logic 💼

### Problem Statement
In modern financial markets, successful trading requires:
- Processing vast amounts of data 📊
- Analyzing multiple market regimes 📈
- Adapting to changing conditions 🔄
- Managing risk effectively 🛡️
- Making decisions with incomplete information ⚖️

### Solution
Our multi-agent system addresses these challenges through:
- Distributed intelligence across specialized agents
- Self-supervision and adaptation
- Confidence-based decision making
- Real-time market regime detection
- Robust risk management frameworks

> **Note**: The system includes 6 specialized trading agents, but only the Technical Agent has basic regime detection. The sophisticated HMM-based `RegimeDetectionService` exists but is not started in the API, leaving the system operating at ~10% of its regime detection potential.

## Workflow Description 🔄

### Theoretical Foundation

1. **Market Regime Theory** 📚
   - Markets exhibit different behavioral patterns (trending, ranging, volatile)
   - Each regime requires different trading strategies
   - Regime detection requires multiple indicators and confidence measures

2. **Self-Supervision Principles** 🧠
   - Agents learn from their own performance
   - Continuous adaptation to market conditions
   - Confidence-based decision making

3. **Risk Management Framework** 🛡️
   - Multi-level confidence thresholds
   - Position sizing based on confidence scores
   - Dynamic stop-loss adjustment

### Practical Implementation

1. **Data Flow** 📊
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant MD as Market Data
       participant TA as Technical Agent
       participant SA as Sentiment Agent
       participant SV as Supervisor
       
       MD->>TA: Price & Volume Data
       MD->>SA: News & Social Data
       TA->>TA: Detect Market Regime
       SA->>SA: Analyze Sentiment
       TA->>SV: Report Confidence & Signals
       SA->>SV: Report Confidence & Signals
       SV->>SV: Evaluate Performance

## Key Components 🔑

### 1. Supervisor Agent 👨‍💼
- Manages agent lifecycle
- Monitors performance
- Optimizes parameters
- Coordinates decisions

### 2. Technical Agent 📈
- Market regime detection
- Technical analysis
- Trend/momentum analysis
- Volatility assessment

### 3. Reversion Agent 🔄

## Real-World Example 🌟

### Scenario: Market Regime Change

1. **Initial State**
   ```python
   market_regime = "ranging"
   confidence = 0.52
   ```

2. **Agent Actions**
   - Technical Agent: Detects ranging market
   - Reversion Agent: Generates mean reversion signals
   - Sentiment Agent: Monitors mood shifts

3. **Supervisor Response**
   - Validates regime confidence
