## GPU Acceleration

### What is GPU Acceleration?

GPU acceleration uses graphics processing units to dramatically speed up model training and inference. This can reduce training times from hours to minutes and enable real-time predictions.

### Getting Started with GPU

#### 1. Check GPU Availability

Navigate to the **GPU Monitoring** tab in your dashboard to see:
- Available GPU devices
- Memory usage and temperature
- Current utilization
- Driver and CUDA versions

#### 2. Enable GPU for Model Training

When training models, GPU acceleration is automatically used if available:

```python
# GPU acceleration is automatic
training_request = {
    "model_type": "lstm_predictor",
    "data": your_market_data,
    "parameters": {
        "sequence_length": 60,
        "hidden_size": 128,
        "batch_size": 64  # Larger batches benefit from GPU
    }
}
```

#### 3. Monitor Training Jobs

Use the dashboard to:
- Track training progress
- Monitor GPU utilization
- View job queue status
- Compare GPU vs CPU performance

### Best Practices

- **Batch Size**: Use larger batch sizes (32-128) for better GPU utilization
- **Model Size**: Larger models benefit more from GPU acceleration
- **Data Loading**: Ensure data loading doesn't become the bottleneck
- **Memory Management**: Monitor GPU memory to avoid out-of-memory errors

### Troubleshooting GPU Issues

**Problem**: GPU not detected
- **Solution**: Check CUDA installation and driver compatibility

**Problem**: Out of memory errors
- **Solution**: Reduce batch size or model complexity

**Problem**: Low GPU utilization
- **Solution**: Increase batch size or use mixed precision training

## Explainable AI

### What is Explainable AI?

Explainable AI helps you understand why your models make specific predictions. This is crucial for:
- Building trust in automated trading decisions
- Meeting regulatory compliance requirements
- Debugging model behavior
- Improving model performance

### Using Explainable AI

#### 1. Enable Explanations

In the **Explainability** tab, you can:
- View model interpretability scores
- Generate explanations for specific predictions
- Compare different explainer types (SHAP, LIME)

#### 2. Generate Explanations

For any prediction, you can request an explanation:

```json
{
  "model_id": "your_model",
  "input_data": [[150.0, 155.0, 145.0, 152.0, 1000000]],
  "explainer_type": "shap",
  "feature_names": ["open", "high", "low", "close", "volume"]
}
```

#### 3. Interpret Results

The explanation will show:
- **Feature Importance**: Which features most influenced the prediction
- **SHAP Values**: How much each feature contributed to the decision
- **Visualizations**: Charts showing the decision process
- **Confidence Score**: How certain the model is about its prediction

### Understanding Explanations

#### Feature Importance Chart
Shows which features (price, volume, indicators) most influence predictions.

#### Waterfall Plot
Shows how each feature pushes the prediction above or below the baseline.

#### Force Plot
Interactive visualization showing feature contributions for individual predictions.

### Best Practices

- **Regular Monitoring**: Check explanations regularly to ensure model behavior is sensible
- **Feature Engineering**: Use explanations to guide feature selection and engineering
- **Threshold Setting**: Set confidence thresholds based on explanation quality
- **Documentation**: Save explanations for compliance and audit purposes

## Data Quality Pipeline

### What is Data Quality?

The data quality pipeline automatically validates your data and provides quality scores. This ensures you're making trading decisions based on reliable data.

### Understanding Quality Scores

Quality is measured across four dimensions:

1. **Completeness** (95-100%): Are there missing values?
2. **Validity** (90-100%): Are values within expected ranges?
3. **Consistency** (85-100%): Is data consistent across sources?
4. **Timeliness** (90-100%): Is data fresh and up-to-date?

### Using the Data Quality Dashboard

#### 1. Monitor Overall Quality

The main dashboard shows:
- Overall quality score (0-100%)
- Quality trends over time
- Number of issues found
- Data freshness indicators

#### 2. View Detailed Reports

Click on any dataset to see:
- Column-level quality scores
- Specific issues identified
- Recommendations for improvement
- Historical quality trends

#### 3. Set Quality Thresholds

Configure automatic alerts when quality drops below:
- **Critical**: 60% (halt trading)
- **Warning**: 80% (reduce position sizes)
- **Good**: 90% (normal operation)

### Quality-Driven Trading

Your trading strategies can automatically adapt based on data quality:

```python
# Example: Adjust position size based on data quality
if quality_score > 0.9:
    position_size = base_position * 1.0  # Full position
elif quality_score > 0.8:
    position_size = base_position * 0.7  # Reduced position
else:
    position_size = 0  # No trading on poor quality data
```

### Common Quality Issues

**Missing Data**
- **Cause**: Exchange downtime, network issues
- **Solution**: Use data interpolation or wait for fresh data

**Price Outliers**
- **Cause**: Flash crashes, data errors
- **Solution**: Implement outlier detection and filtering

**Stale Data**
- **Cause**: Feed delays, processing issues
- **Solution**: Check data timestamps and freshness

## Data Lake Explorer

### What is the Data Lake?

The data lake stores all your trading data in three layers:
- **Bronze**: Raw data as received
- **Silver**: Cleaned and validated data
- **Gold**: Business-ready analytics datasets

### Using the Data Lake Explorer

#### 1. Browse Datasets

In the **Datasets** tab:
- Search and filter datasets by layer, type, or tags
- View dataset metadata and schema
- Check data quality scores
- See storage size and record counts

#### 2. Query Data

Use the **Query** tab for SQL analysis:

```sql
-- Example: Analyze average daily returns by symbol
SELECT 
    symbol,
    DATE(date_time) as trade_date,
    AVG((close - open) / open * 100) as avg_daily_return
FROM market_data_ohlcv_silver
WHERE date_time >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY symbol, trade_date
ORDER BY avg_daily_return DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### 3. Profile Data

Use the profiling tools to:
- Generate statistical summaries
- Identify correlations between features
- Find data quality issues
- Get optimization recommendations

#### 4. Monitor Performance

The **Analytics** tab shows:
