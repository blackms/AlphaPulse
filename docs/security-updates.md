# Security Updates and Dependency Management

## Overview

AlphaPulse uses automated security scanning through GitHub's Dependabot to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies. This document outlines our security update process and current status.

## Security Update Process

1. **Automated Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot continuously scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities
2. **Regular Updates**: Security updates are performed at least monthly or when critical vulnerabilities are discovered
3. **Testing**: All updates undergo comprehensive testing before deployment
4. **Documentation**: Each security update is documented in SECURITY_UPDATE.md

## Recent Security Updates (v1.8.0.0)

### Updated Packages
- **aiohttp**: 3.10.11 → 3.11.18 (addressed multiple security vulnerabilities)
- **setuptools**: 79.0.1 → 80.9.0 (general security improvements)
- **cryptography**: 42.0.0 → 44.0.0 (enhanced cryptographic security)

### Security Tools

#### Update Script
Use the provided script to check and update vulnerable dependencies:

```bash
python scripts/update_dependencies.py
```

#### Manual Security Check
```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Update all packages (use with caution)
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Update Poetry dependencies
poetry update
```

## Known Issues and Mitigations

### Transitive Dependencies
Some vulnerabilities may exist in transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies). These are harder to control directly but can be mitigated by:
- Keeping direct dependencies up-to-date
- Using tools like `pip-audit` for comprehensive scanning
- Pinning specific versions when necessary

### False Positives
Not all reported vulnerabilities may be applicable to our use case. Each alert should be evaluated for:
- Actual impact on the application
- Whether the vulnerable code path is used
- Available patches or workarounds

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Run security checks weekly
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test after updates
3. **Document Changes**: Keep SECURITY_UPDATE.md current
4. **Monitor Alerts**: Check GitHub security tab regularly
5. **Rapid Response**: Address critical vulnerabilities within 48 hours

## Automated Security Measures

### Pre-commit Hooks
Consider adding security checks to pre-commit hooks:
```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
  rev: '1.7.5'
  hooks:
    - id: bandit
      args: ['-ll', '-i']
```

### CI/CD Integration
Security scanning should be part of the CI/CD pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    pip install safety
    safety check -r requirements.txt
```
