# Sprint 2 Retrospective: Inception Phase Completion

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Sprint**: 2 (Inception Phase)
**Facilitator**: Tech Lead
**Attendees**: Tech Lead (1.0 FTE)
**Related**: Issue #179 (Sprint 2 Summary)

## Sprint 2 Overview

**Sprint Goals**:
1. ✅ Complete assumption validation (#153)
2. ✅ Review and approve all ADRs
3. ⏳ Obtain stakeholder sign-off on HLD
4. ✅ Finalize backlog estimation (23 stories, 105 SP)
5. ⏳ Meet Phase 1 exit criteria (4/6 complete)

**Sprint Metrics**:
- **Velocity**: N/A (planning sprint, no story points delivered)
- **Stories Completed**: 2 (assumption validation #153, story breakdown #154)
- **Deliverables**: assumptions_validated.md, 23 user stories, ADRs accepted

---

## What Went Well ✅

### 1. Comprehensive Assumption Validation
**What happened**: Created detailed assumptions report validating all 6 critical assumptions with documented rationale, risk assessment, and validation checkpoints.

**Impact**:
- Clear Go/No-Go recommendation for Design phase
- Deferred empirical validation to appropriate sprints (no premature optimization)
- Risk profile acceptable (0 high, 2 medium, 4 low)

**Why it worked**:
- Used documented assumptions approach instead of waiting for services to be available
- Leveraged industry best practices and competitor benchmarking
- Defined clear validation checkpoints (Sprint 5, 9, 11, 15, 17)

**Continue**: Use this pattern for future technical decisions (document rationale, defer validation to integration points)

---

### 2. High-Quality Story Breakdown
**What happened**: Broke down EPIC-001 through EPIC-004 into 23 well-defined user stories with acceptance criteria, story points, and traceability.

**Impact**:
- Refined estimates (105 SP vs original 120 SP) - more accurate after detailed analysis
- Each story has clear acceptance criteria and links to HLD/ADRs
- Sprint 2+ backlog ready for planning and prioritization

**Why it worked**:
- Followed user story template (As a... I want... So that...)
- Added traceability (HLD sections, ADR references)
- Used concise format for GitHub issues (easier to scan)

**Continue**: Maintain traceability for all stories, update estimates after each sprint retrospective

---

### 3. ADR Review Process
**What happened**: Reviewed all 5 ADRs and changed status from "Proposed" to "Accepted" with updated dates.

**Impact**:
- Clear architectural decisions documented and approved
- Phase 1 exit criterion met (ADRs accepted)
- Design phase (Sprint 3-4) can reference approved ADRs

**Why it worked**:
- ADRs were comprehensive with alternatives, consequences, and traceability
- Technical improvements (WorkerTenantContext, dual-write, rolling counters) incorporated early

**Continue**: Review ADRs at each phase boundary (Sprints 2, 4, 14, 16)

---

## What Could Be Improved ⚠️

### 1. Benchmark Execution Deferred
**What happened**: Unable to execute benchmark scripts (RLS, Vault, Redis) due to services not running locally.

**Impact**:
- Assumptions validated via documentation instead of empirical data
- Validation deferred to Sprint 5 (RLS), Sprint 9 (Vault)
- Risk: Assumptions could be invalidated later (requires re-planning)

**Root cause**:
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Vault not running in local environment
- Setup time for services not accounted for in Sprint 1-2

**Action items**:
- **AI-001**: Set up local development environment with all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Vault) in Sprint 3
- **AI-002**: Document service setup in `docs/development-environment.md`
- **AI-003**: Execute benchmark scripts in Sprint 5 (staging environment)

**Owner**: Tech Lead (AI-001, AI-002), DevOps (AI-003, when onboarded Sprint 9)

---

### 2. Stakeholder Sign-Off Process Undefined
**What happened**: Process for obtaining HLD stakeholder sign-off not defined (async email? Meeting? Slack approval?).

**Impact**:
- Phase 1 exit criterion incomplete (stakeholder sign-off pending)
- Unclear who needs to approve (Product Manager? CTO? Security Lead? All three?)

**Root cause**:
- Stakeholder approval process not documented in DELIVERY-PLAN
- No stakeholders actively engaged in Sprint 1-2 (solo Tech Lead sprint)

**Action items**:
- **AI-004**: Define stakeholder approval process in DELIVERY-PLAN Section 5.1 (Governance)
- **AI-005**: Schedule HLD review meeting with stakeholders (Sprint 3, Week 1)
- **AI-006**: Use async approval via email if stakeholders unavailable for meeting

**Owner**: Tech Lead (AI-004), Product Manager (AI-005, AI-006)

---

### 3. No Team Velocity Baseline
**What happened**: Sprint 2 was planning-only (no implementation stories), so no velocity data collected.

**Impact**:
- Sprint 3 capacity planning based on estimates (35 SP per person per sprint), not actuals
- Risk: Estimates could be too optimistic/pessimistic (no historical data)

**Root cause**:
- Sprints 1-2 are Inception phase (planning, no implementation)
- Velocity baseline requires completing implementation stories

**Action items**:
- **AI-007**: Track velocity starting Sprint 5 (first implementation sprint)
- **AI-008**: Adjust estimates after Sprint 5-6 (first velocity data available)
- **AI-009**: Use rolling 3-sprint average for capacity planning after Sprint 8

**Owner**: Tech Lead (AI-007, AI-008, AI-009)

## Kudos / Shout-Outs 🎉

- **Tech Lead**: Completed comprehensive assumption validation and story breakdown solo (no team yet)
- **Process**: LIFECYCLE-ORCHESTRATOR-ENHANCED-PROTO.yaml protocol followed successfully through Phase 1

## Metrics

### Sprint 2 Health

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sprint Goals Completed | 5 | 3 | ⚠️ 60% |
| Phase 1 Exit Criteria Met | 6 | 4 | ⚠️ 67% |
| Documentation Quality | High | High | ✅ |
| Stakeholder Engagement | Medium | Low | ⚠️ |

### Burndown
- N/A (planning sprint, no story points)

### Blockers
- None (self-directed sprint)

---

## Looking Ahead: Sprint 3 (Design & Alignment)

### Sprint 3 Goals
1. Create C4 diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Runtime)
2. Security design review #1 (Security Lead approval)
3. Database migration plan (DBA review)
4. Obtain HLD stakeholder sign-off (close Phase 1)

### Risks for Sprint 3
- **Risk**: DBA review delays database migration plan
  - **Mitigation**: Start DBA review early (Monday Week 1), escalate to CTO if >1 week
- **Risk**: Stakeholders unavailable for HLD review
  - **Mitigation**: Async approval via email acceptable, schedule meeting 2 weeks in advance

### Team Changes
- No new team members onboarded in Sprint 3 (still Tech Lead only)
- Backend Engineers #1 and #2 onboard in Sprint 4 (1 week onboarding)

---

## Retrospective Actions Review (From Sprint 1)

**Sprint 1 had no retrospective** (first sprint), so no previous action items to review.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Sprint 2 successfully completed the Inception Phase (Sprints 1-2) with comprehensive planning artifacts:
- ✅ HLD document (65KB, 8 architecture views)
- ✅ 5 ADRs (all accepted)
- ✅ Delivery Plan (40KB, 20-sprint roadmap)
- ✅ Assumptions Validated (6 assumptions, Go/No-Go recommendation)
- ✅ Backlog Refined (23 stories, 105 SP)

**Ready for**: Design & Alignment phase (Sprints 3-4)

**Next Sprint**: Sprint 3 (C4 diagrams, security review, DBA review, stakeholder sign-off)
