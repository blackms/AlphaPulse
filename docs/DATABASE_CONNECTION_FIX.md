# Database Connection Fix for AlphaPulse Data Pipeline

## Issue Summary

The AlphaPulse data pipeline was experiencing critical database connection errors during synchronization operations with the Bybit exchange. These errors manifested as:

1. `InterfaceError: cannot perform operation: another operation is in progress`
2. `ConnectionDoesNotExistError: connection was closed in the middle of operation`
3. `Task got Future attached to a different loop` errors

These issues were causing synchronization tasks to fail and database connections to remain unstable, particularly during concurrent operations.

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, we identified several interconnected root causes:

### 1. Event Loop Conflicts

The error `Task got Future attached to a different loop` indicates that a task created in one event loop was attempting to interact with a future object owned by a different event loop. This is a common issue in asynchronous applications that use multiple threads or nested event loops.

In our case, the synchronizer module was running with multiple synchronization tasks but wasn't properly isolating database operations between different event loops.

### 2. Improper Connection Management

The `InterfaceError: cannot perform operation: another operation is in progress` occurs when attempting to use a connection that is already executing an operation. This suggests that:

- Connection objects were being shared improperly between concurrent operations
- No proper connection pooling strategy was implemented
- Transactions weren't being properly isolated

### 3. Connection Stability Issues

The `ConnectionDoesNotExistError: connection was closed in the middle of operation` indicates that connections were being closed unexpectedly during operations. This could be due to:

- Improper connection cleanup after errors
- Timeout settings too aggressive
- Missing transaction management
- No strategy for handling connection failures

## Implemented Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive solution with several components:

### 1. Enhanced Connection Pooling

The `connection_manager.py` module provides:

- Thread and event-loop specific connection pools
- Automatic pool creation and management
- Proper connection isolation between different threads and event loops
- Pool health monitoring and recreation when needed

### 2. Robust Transaction Management

The `get_db_connection()` async context manager:

- Creates and manages transactions automatically
- Handles proper transaction commit and rollback
- Ensures connections are returned to the pool
- Includes thorough error handling

### 3. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

The `execute_with_retry()` function:

- Retries failed database operations with exponential backoff
- Handles specific database connection errors intelligently
- Includes jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Resets connection pools when connection errors occur

### 4. Consistent Thread and Loop Identification

The `get_loop_thread_key()` function:

- Creates a unique key for each thread and event loop combination
- Ensures operations from different contexts don't interfere
- Provides consistent identification for logging and debugging

## Usage Guidelines

### For General Database Operations

```python
from alpha_pulse.data_pipeline.database.connection_manager import get_db_connection, execute_with_retry

# Use the connection manager for all database operations
async def perform_database_operation():
    async with get_db_connection() as conn:
        # All operations within this block use the same connection
        # and are part of the same transaction
        result = await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM some_table")
        await conn.execute("INSERT INTO other_table VALUES ($1)", some_value)
        # Transaction is automatically committed when the block exits
        # or rolled back if an exception occurs
        return result

# For operations that might need retrying
async def get_important_data():
    async def operation():
        async with get_db_connection() as conn:
            return await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM important_table")
    
    # This will retry with backoff if connection errors occur
    return await execute_with_retry(operation)
```

### For Synchronizer and Other Multi-threaded Code

1. Always use the connection management tools provided
2. Avoid sharing connections between tasks
3. Let the connection manager handle connection lifecycle
4. Use proper error handling and transaction management

## Testing

To verify the database connection fixes:

1. Run the test script using the provided script:
   ```bash
   ./run_connection_test.sh
   ```

2. This test will:
   - Validate database connectivity
   - Run multiple concurrent sync operations
   - Test operations across different threads
   - Verify connection isolation and retry logic

3. Review the generated logs for any errors

## Future Considerations

1. **Monitoring**: Add connection pool metrics to the monitoring system
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement a circuit breaker for database operations to prevent cascading failures
3. **Connection Timeouts**: Fine-tune connection and statement timeouts based on production patterns
4. **Load Testing**: Perform thorough load testing to validate behavior under high concurrency
5. **Observability**: Add more detailed logging for connection lifecycle events
