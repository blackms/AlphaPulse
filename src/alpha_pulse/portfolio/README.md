# 📊 Portfolio Rebalancing Module

This module provides advanced portfolio rebalancing capabilities using modern portfolio optimization techniques. It supports multiple allocation strategies and is exchange-agnostic, working with any exchange that implements the required interface.

## 🎯 Overview

The portfolio module helps you:
- 📈 Analyze current portfolio allocations in real-time
- 🎯 Calculate optimal target allocations using multiple strategies
- 🔄 Generate smart rebalancing recommendations
- 📊 Track portfolio metrics and performance

## 💼 Allocation Strategies

### 1. 📈 Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

MPT, developed by Harry Markowitz, optimizes portfolios based on the trade-off between expected return and risk. The strategy:
- 🧮 Uses quadratic programming for optimization
- 📊 Calculates expected returns using exponentially weighted moving averages
- 🔄 Computes covariance matrices with shrinkage estimators
- ⚖️ Finds optimal weights maximizing the Sharpe ratio
- 🎯 Handles constraints through sequential quadratic programming

Key features:
- 📊 Mean-variance optimization with robust covariance estimation
- 📈 Risk-adjusted returns using configurable risk-free rate
- 🎯 Support for complex constraints (min/max weights, sector exposure)
- 📉 Interactive efficient frontier visualization

### 2. 🌳 Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)

HRP, developed by Marcos Lopez de Prado, provides a more robust alternative to MPT that:
- 🔍 Uses correlation-based distance metrics
- 🌳 Implements quasi-diagonalization for clustering
- ⚖️ Allocates weights through recursive bisection
- 📊 Handles numerical instabilities with advanced techniques

Implementation details:
- 🔢 Uses UPGMA clustering algorithm
- 📊 Implements inverse-variance allocation
- 🔄 Supports dynamic reclustering
- 📈 Provides cluster visualization

### 3. 🎯 Black-Litterman Model

The Black-Litterman model combines market equilibrium returns with investor views:
- 🌍 Uses market cap weights as Bayesian prior
- 📊 Implements full covariance estimation
- 🎯 Supports multiple confidence levels
- 🔄 Handles missing data through statistical inference

Technical implementation:
- 🧮 Uses reverse optimization for equilibrium returns
- 📊 Implements Bayesian updating with uncertainty
- 🎯 Supports both absolute and relative views
- 📈 Provides posterior distribution analysis

### 4. 🤖 LLM-Assisted Strategy

Optional LLM enhancement that can wrap any base strategy:
- 📰 Processes real-time news and sentiment data
- 🔍 Analyzes market trends and correlations
- 🎯 Provides dynamic risk assessments
- 💡 Generates natural language explanations

Implementation details:
- 🔄 Uses async processing for real-time updates
- 📊 Implements sentiment scoring algorithms
- 🎯 Supports multiple LLM providers
- 📈 Provides confidence metrics for suggestions

## 💻 Usage Example

```python
from alpha_pulse.portfolio.portfolio_manager import PortfolioManager
from your_exchange_implementation import YourExchange

# Initialize exchange with your credentials
exchange = YourExchange(
    api_key="your_key",
    api_secret="your_secret"
)

# Initialize portfolio manager with config
manager = PortfolioManager("portfolio_config.yaml")

# Get current allocation
current_allocation = manager.get_current_allocation(exchange)

# Execute rebalancing if needed
result = manager.rebalance_portfolio(exchange)

if result['status'] == 'completed':
    print("\nRebalancing completed:")
    print("\nInitial allocation:")
    for asset, weight in result['initial_allocation'].items():
        print(f"{asset}: {weight:.2%}")
        
    print("\nTarget allocation:")
    for asset, weight in result['target_allocation'].items():
        print(f"{asset}: {weight:.2%}")
        
    print("\nExecuted trades:")
    for trade in result['trades']:
        print(f"{trade['type'].upper()} {trade['asset']}: "
              f"${abs(trade['value']):,.2f}")
```

## 🔌 Exchange Integration

To use your preferred exchange, implement the `IExchange` interface:

```python
from alpha_pulse.portfolio.interfaces import IExchange
from decimal import Decimal

class YourExchange(IExchange):
    def get_account_balances(self) -> Dict[str, Decimal]:
        # Implement getting account balances
        pass
        
    def get_ticker_prices(self, assets: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Decimal]:
        # Implement getting current prices
        pass
        
    def get_portfolio_value(self) -> Decimal:
        # Implement getting total portfolio value
        pass
        
    def execute_trade(self, asset: str, amount: Decimal,
                     side: str, order_type: str = "market") -> Dict:
        # Implement trade execution
        pass
        
    def get_historical_data(self, assets: List[str],
                          start_time: pd.Timestamp,
                          end_time: Optional[pd.Timestamp] = None,
                          interval: str = "1d") -> pd.DataFrame:
        # Implement historical data fetching
        pass
```
