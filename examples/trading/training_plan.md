# RL Trading Training Plan

## Current Issues
1. Training process is too resource-intensive and gets interrupted
2. Large number of training steps (500,000) may be causing stability issues
3. Multiple processes being spawned may be overwhelming system resources

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Reduce Training Load
- Decrease total timesteps from 500,000 to 100,000 initially
- Reduce batch size from 512 to 256
- Lower number of parallel environments from 4 to 2

### 2. Improve Resource Management
- Add memory monitoring
- Implement graceful shutdown handling
- Add checkpointing at more frequent intervals (every 5,000 steps)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Add proper cleanup of resources on interruption
- Implement training resumption from last checkpoint
- Add detailed logging of resource usage

### 4. Progressive Training Approach
1. Start with a smaller training run to validate setup
2. Gradually increase parameters if successful
3. Implement validation checks between training phases

## Implementation Steps

1. Modify rl_config.yaml:
```yaml
training:
  total_timesteps: 100000  # Reduced from 500000
  batch_size: 256         # Reduced from 512
  checkpoint_freq: 5000   # More frequent checkpoints
```

2. Update demo_rl_trading.py:
- Add memory monitoring
- Implement signal handlers for graceful shutdown
- Add resource cleanup in finally block
- Implement checkpoint loading/saving

3. Testing Plan:
- Run initial training with reduced parameters
- Monitor resource usage and stability
- Gradually increase parameters if successful
- Validate model performance at each stage

## Success Criteria
1. Training completes without interruption
2. Model performance meets minimum threshold
3. Resource usage remains stable
4. Checkpoints are properly saved and can be loaded

## Next Steps
1. Implement the proposed changes
2. Test with reduced parameters
3. Analyze results and adjust as needed
4. Scale up gradually if successful
