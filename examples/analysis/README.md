# Analysis Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating feature engineering, model training, and analysis capabilities in AlphaPulse.

## Available Examples

- `demo_feature_engineering.py` - Feature engineering techniques
  - Technical indicator calculation
  - Market microstructure features
  - Sentiment analysis integration
  - Feature normalization and preprocessing

- `demo_model_training.py` - Model training workflows
  - Data preparation
  - Model architecture setup
  - Training process
  - Model evaluation
  - Hyperparameter tuning

- `train_test_model.py` - Complete model training pipeline
  - Train/test split methodology
