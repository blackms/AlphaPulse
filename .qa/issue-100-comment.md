## âœ… Issue Resolved

This issue has been successfully fixed and merged via PR #104.

### Summary of Fix

**Problem:** EnsembleService was being initialized without the required database session parameter, causing a TypeError at API startup.

**Solution:**
1. **Database Session Injection** - Created `initialize_ensemble_service()` function that properly obtains a DB session via `get_db_session()` and injects it into the EnsembleService constructor
2. **Async/Await Fix** - Updated `AgentManager` to properly await the async ensemble prediction call, preventing coroutine leaks
3. **Graceful Cleanup** - Added shutdown handler to properly close the database session when the API stops
4. **Backward Compatibility** - Added wrapper method to handle both dict and typed model inputs

### Changes Merged
- `src/alpha_pulse/api/main.py` - Session injection and lifecycle management
- `src/alpha_pulse/agents/manager.py` - Fixed async await pattern
- `src/alpha_pulse/services/ensemble_service.py` - Backward-compatible API wrapper
- Comprehensive regression tests added

### Quality Assurance
- âœ… **Senior Dev Review:** Approved
- âœ… **QA Team Review:** 88/100 quality score
- âœ… **CI/CD:** All checks passing
- âœ… **Tests:** 2/2 regression tests passing
- âœ… **Risk Level:** Low

### Testing
The fix has been validated with:
- Unit tests using AST parsing to verify session injection
- Integration tests for async ensemble prediction behavior
- Graceful failure tests for error handling
- All existing tests continue to pass

### Deployed
The fix is now merged to main and ready for deployment.
