4. Error Handling
   - Gracefully handle unexpected responses
   - Provide clear error messages

5. Project Analysis Boundaries
   - Respect project boundaries when analyzing code
   - Don't make assumptions about external dependencies
   - Focus analysis on files explicitly shared or referenced

6. Existing Project Respect
