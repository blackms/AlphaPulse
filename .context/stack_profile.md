# AlphaPulse Stack Profile

## System Overview

AlphaPulse is a sophisticated AI-driven hedge fund system implementing a multi-agent trading architecture. The system is designed to perform backtesting of the S&P 500 index with a focus on risk management and portfolio optimization.

## Architecture

The system follows a multi-layered architecture with four main components:

1. **Input Layer (Specialized Agents)**
   - Multiple specialized trading agents that analyze different aspects of the market
   - Agent Manager for coordinating signals from different agents

2. **Risk Management Layer**
   - Risk Manager for evaluating trades against risk criteria
   - Position Sizer for determining optimal position sizes
   - Risk Analyzer for calculating risk metrics

3. **Portfolio Management Layer**
   - Portfolio Manager for allocation and rebalancing
   - Multiple portfolio optimization strategies (MPT, HRP, Black-Litterman, LLM-assisted)

4. **Output Layer (Trading Actions)**
   - Trade Router for executing trades
   - Order Management for tracking positions

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with Uvicorn
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL 13+ with TimescaleDB extension (for time-series data)
  - Redis (for caching and pub/sub messaging)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets for live data streaming

### Frontend (Dashboard)

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Data Visualization**: Likely using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js

### Data Processing

- **Data Analysis**: pandas, numpy, scipy
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, potentially TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Financial Analysis**: pyfolio, empyrical, ta (technical analysis)
- **Portfolio Optimization**: pyportfolioopt

### External Integrations

- **Market Data**: FRED API, Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI
- **Exchange Connectivity**: Bybit (based on file references)
- **Economic Data**: FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: NewsAPI, potentially Twitter API

### DevOps & Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Docker (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml present)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus (prometheus.yml present)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (based on .github directory)
- **Testing**: pytest (based on .pytest_cache directory)

## Key Components

### Agent System

The system implements six specialized trading agents:
1. **ActivistAgent**: Models activist investor strategies
2. **ValueAgent**: Focuses on value investing principles
3. **FundamentalAgent**: Analyzes fundamental company data
4. **SentimentAgent**: Analyzes market sentiment
5. **TechnicalAgent**: Uses technical analysis
6. **ValuationAgent**: Focuses on company valuation

### Risk Management

The risk management system includes:
- Position sizing based on volatility and signal strength
- Portfolio-level risk controls (leverage, drawdown)
- Stop-loss calculation
- VaR (Value at Risk) and other risk metrics

### Portfolio Management

The portfolio management system supports multiple strategies:
- Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
- Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)
- Black-Litterman model
- LLM-assisted portfolio optimization

### API Structure

The API is organized into the following endpoints:
1. **Metrics**: Performance metrics
2. **Alerts**: System alerts
3. **Portfolio**: Portfolio management
4. **Trades**: Trade execution
5. **System**: System status and management

### Dashboard

The dashboard includes the following main pages:
1. **Dashboard**: Main overview
2. **Portfolio**: Portfolio management
3. **Trading**: Trading interface (not fully implemented)
4. **Alerts**: System alerts
5. **System Status**: System monitoring
6. **Diagnostics**: System diagnostics
7. **Settings**: System settings

## Development Practices

- **Code Organization**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with logging
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration files
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation in Markdown format
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with pytest

## Deployment Model

Based on the presence of Docker files and deployment documentation, the system appears to be designed for containerized deployment, potentially in a cloud environment or on-premises server.

## Conclusion

AlphaPulse is a sophisticated, multi-agent trading system with a comprehensive architecture covering all aspects of algorithmic trading, from data ingestion to trade execution. The system is built with modern technologies and follows good software engineering practices.
