# Bybit Connection Debugging

This document explains the changes made to the `debug_bybit_connection.py` script and how to use it.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Order Fetching**
   - Updated the script to use `fetch_open_orders` and `fetch_closed_orders` instead of the deprecated `fetch_orders` method
   - This addresses the Bybit API change for UTA accounts after the 5/02 update

2. **Used Custom Methods**
   - Modified the script to use our custom exchange methods instead of direct CCXT access
   - This ensures consistency with our application's exchange abstraction layer

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure you have the required Python packages installed
   - Make sure your Bybit API credentials are properly configured

2. **Running the Script**
   ```bash
   python debug_bybit_connection.py
   ```

3. **What the Script Does**
   - Initializes the Bybit exchange connection
   - Tests getting balances
   - Tests getting positions
   - Tests getting orders (open and closed)
   - Tests getting ticker price for BTC/USDT
   - Saves test results to a JSON file

4. **Output**
   - The script will log detailed information about each test
   - A summary JSON file is created with the timestamp in the format: `bybit_connection_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication Problems**
   - Verify your API credentials are correct
   - Check that your API key has the necessary permissions

2. **Connection Issues**
   - Check your network connection
   - Verify that the Bybit API is operational

3. **Order Fetching Errors**
   - The script now uses the supported methods for UTA accounts
   - If you still see errors, check the Bybit API documentation for any recent changes

## Notes

- The script uses the credentials manager from the `alpha_pulse` package
- All tests are performed against the Bybit mainnet (not testnet)
- Non-critical errors are logged but don't cause the script to fail
