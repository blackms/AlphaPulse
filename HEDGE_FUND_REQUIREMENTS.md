# AI Hedge Fund System Requirements

## System Overview
The system implements an AI-driven hedge fund architecture with multiple specialized agents feeding into a risk management system that ultimately drives portfolio management decisions.

## Component Requirements

### 1. Input Layer - Specialized Agents
Each agent operates independently to generate trading signals:

#### Bill Ackman Agent
- Analyzes activist investing patterns
- Focuses on company restructuring opportunities
- Generates trading signals based on activist investment strategies

#### Warren Buffett Agent
- Implements value investing principles
- Analyzes fundamental company metrics
- Focuses on long-term value opportunities

#### Fundamentals Agent
- Processes company financial statements
- Analyzes economic indicators
- Evaluates market fundamentals

#### Sentiment Agent
- Processes market sentiment data
- Analyzes social media and news
- Evaluates market psychology

#### Technical Agent
- Implements technical analysis
- Processes price and volume data
- Generates technical trading signals

#### Valuation Agent
- Focuses on company valuations
- Analyzes price ratios and metrics
- Evaluates fair value estimates

### 2. Risk Management Layer
The Risk Manager component:
- Aggregates signals from all agents
- Evaluates signal consistency
- Performs risk assessment
- Implements risk controls
- Validates trading signals
- Ensures portfolio risk compliance

### 3. Portfolio Management Layer
The Portfolio Manager:
- Processes risk-adjusted signals
- Makes final trading decisions
- Manages position sizing
- Handles portfolio rebalancing
- Implements trading strategy
- Monitors portfolio performance

### 4. Output Layer - Trading Actions
The system can execute the following actions:
- Buy: Enter long positions
- Cover: Close short positions
- Sell: Exit long positions
- Short: Enter short positions
- Hold: Maintain current positions

## Business Logic Flow

1. Signal Generation (Input Layer)
   - Each agent continuously analyzes its specific domain
   - Agents generate trading signals independently
   - Signals include direction and confidence levels

2. Risk Processing (Risk Management Layer)
   - Aggregate signals from all agents
   - Apply risk filters and controls
   - Validate signal consistency
   - Generate risk-adjusted recommendations

3. Portfolio Decisions (Portfolio Management Layer)
   - Process risk-adjusted signals
   - Consider current portfolio state
   - Apply position sizing rules
   - Generate final trading decisions

4. Action Execution (Output Layer)
   - Execute trading decisions
   - Monitor execution
   - Update portfolio state
   - Track performance metrics
