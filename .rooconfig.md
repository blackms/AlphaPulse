# AlphaPulse Configuration

## Project Profile

**Project Name:** AlphaPulse  
**Project Type:** AI-powered Algorithmic Trading System  
**Solo Developer Workflow:** AI-assisted development  
**Last Updated:** March 9, 2025

## Technology Identification

### Primary Languages
- **Python 3.9+**: Backend, data processing, trading algorithms
- **TypeScript**: Frontend dashboard
- **SQL**: Database queries and schema

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **Backend**: Custom Python framework
- **Frontend**: React
- **Data Processing**: Likely pandas, numpy, possibly scikit-learn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

### Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB
- **Message Queue**: Possibly Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker-based

## Complexity Assessment

**Classification: Complex**

AlphaPulse is classified as a Complex system according to the Cynefin framework for the following reasons:

1. **Multiple interacting components** with non-linear relationships:
   - Multi-agent architecture with various AI analysis approaches
   - Real-time data processing and trading execution
   - Complex risk management and portfolio optimization

2. **Emergent behaviors**:
   - Trading strategies interact with market conditions in unpredictable ways
   - Multiple AI agents may produce emergent decision patterns
   - Risk management systems must adapt to changing market conditions

3. **Feedback loops**:
   - Market response to trades affects future strategy decisions
   - Performance metrics influence portfolio allocation
   - Real-time monitoring affects system behavior

**Approach Recommendations:**
- Enable experimentation with controlled risk exposure
- Implement robust monitoring and feedback collection
- Create adaptable components that can be reconfigured easily
- Focus on resilience and fault tolerance over perfect prediction

## Development Philosophy

The project appears to follow these development philosophies:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Clear separation between data pipeline, trading engine, monitoring
   - Modular approach to strategies and agents

2. **Domain-Driven Design**:
   - Domain-specific language around trading, risk, and portfolio concepts
   - Organization around bounded contexts (trading, monitoring, alerting)

3. **Feature-Focused Approach**:
   - Features organized around specific capabilities (alerting, monitoring, etc.)
   - Independent feature development is supported by the architecture

Custom instructions for AI modes have been tailored to support these philosophies.

## Team Structure

**Solo Developer with AI Assistance**

As a solo developer project, AlphaPulse is being developed with heavy reliance on AI assistance. The custom modes have been configured to provide specialized AI support for different aspects of the system:

- **Python Development**: Core backend, algorithms, exchange integrations
- **Frontend Development**: Dashboard UI and visualizations
- **Data Infrastructure**: Database, Docker, infrastructure setup
- **Trading Strategy**: Algorithm design and optimization
- **System Architecture**: Overall system design and patterns
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting complex issues
- **Documentation**: Maintaining clear system documentation

## Selected Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Key Capabilities |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **pythondev** | Backend & algorithm development | Python code creation, exchange APIs, data pipelines |
| **frontenddev** | Dashboard & visualization development | React/TypeScript UI, charts, real-time updates |
| **datainfra** | Database & infrastructure management | SQL, Docker, infrastructure configuration |
| **strategist** | Trading algorithm development | Strategy implementation, backtesting, optimization |
| **architect** | System design & planning | Architecture documentation, component interfaces |
| **debugger** | Problem diagnosis & resolution | Full system access for troubleshooting |
| **documenter** | System documentation | Creating & maintaining documentation |
| **test** | Testing & quality assurance | Test creation, validation, result analysis |
| **orchestrator** | Workflow coordination | Task delegation to specialized modes |
| **commander** | Mode configuration | Custom mode management |

## Recommended Workflow

For this complex, solo development project with AI assistance, the following workflow is recommended:

1. **Planning Stage**:
   - Use **architect** mode to design components and define interfaces
   - Use **documenter** mode to create specifications and requirements

2. **Development Stage**:
   - Use **pythondev** for backend implementation
   - Use **frontenddev** for dashboard implementation
   - Use **datainfra** for database and infrastructure setup
   - Use **strategist** for trading algorithm implementation

3. **Testing Stage**:
   - Use **test** mode for creating and running tests
   - Use **debugger** mode for troubleshooting issues

4. **Documentation Stage**:
   - Use **documenter** mode to update documentation

5. **Complex Tasks**:
   - Use **orchestrator** mode to break down complex tasks across multiple specialized modes

This workflow leverages the specialized capabilities of each mode while maintaining a coherent development process suited for a solo developer with AI assistance.
