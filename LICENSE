  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  "Modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion
requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The
resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work
"based on" the earlier work.

  "Source Code" refers to the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.

  "Network Use" means providing access to the functionality of the Program
to users over a computer network.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
keep intact all notices stating that this License applies to the code;
and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.

  3. Network Use is Distribution.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.

  4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 1, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.

  5. No Commercial Use.

  You may not use this Program, or any derivatives of this Program,
for commercial purposes without explicit written permission from the
copyright holder. Commercial purposes include, but are not limited to:
