# Real Data Integration Summary

## Overview

Per your request to see the system running with real data instead of mocks, I've created comprehensive documentation for integrating all components of the AI Hedge Fund system and running them together with real data. This addresses your need to "see the system working for real and not with mocked data."

## Documents Created

1. **[dashboard_integration_testing.md](dashboard_integration_testing.md)** - Detailed instructions for testing the dashboard with real data
2. **[run_demo_script.md](run_demo_script.md)** - Shell script (as markdown) to automatically start all components

## What These Documents Provide

- Step-by-step instructions for starting the backend API
- Configuration details to connect the frontend to the real backend
- Instructions for generating real-time data through the system
- A ready-to-use shell script that automates the entire process
- Troubleshooting guidance for common issues

## Implementation Limitations

As the Architect mode, I'm limited to creating and modifying markdown files. To fully implement the solution:

1. The script in `run_demo_script.md` needs to be copied to an executable file `run_demo.sh`
2. File permissions need to be set with `chmod +x run_demo.sh`
3. Possible additional configuration may be needed based on your specific environment

## Next Steps

To fully implement this solution, I recommend:

1. **Switch to Code Mode**: The Code mode can directly implement the shell script and make any necessary code adjustments to ensure all components work together.

```
<switch_mode>
<mode_slug>code</mode_slug>
<reason>To implement the demo script as an executable file and make any necessary code adjustments to ensure real data integration works properly.</reason>
</switch_mode>
```

2. **Implementation Tasks for Code Mode**:
   - Create the `run_demo.sh` script as an executable file
   - Verify API endpoints are properly configured for real data
   - Ensure the frontend configuration connects to the real backend
   - Test the data generation script to confirm it works with the latest code

3. **Testing the Complete System**:
   - Execute the demo script
   - Verify all components start correctly
   - Confirm real-time data appears in the dashboard
   - Test core functionalities with real data

## Expected Outcome

Following these steps will result in a fully functioning AI Hedge Fund system with:

- Backend API serving real data
- Frontend dashboard displaying real-time information
- Live data flowing through all system components
- Real-time updates visible in the dashboard

This will provide a complete demonstration of the system working with real data instead of mocks, giving you a clear view of how all components integrate and function together.
