## Project Goal

* AlphaPulse is a backtesting system for the S&P 500 index using a multi-agent approach to generate trading signals.
* The system aims to evaluate different trading strategies by simulating trades based on technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis.
* The project is focused on testing the performance of these strategies on historical S&P 500 data.

## Key Features

* Multi-agent system with specialized agents (technical, fundamental, sentiment)
* Data pipeline for fetching and preparing market data from various sources (FRED, Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI)
* Backtesting engine that simulates trades based on agent signals
* Risk management and portfolio optimization
* Performance analysis and visualization
* Configurable parameters through YAML files

## Overall Architecture

* **Data Layer**: DataManager fetches and prepares data from external sources
* **Agent Layer**: Specialized agents analyze data and generate trading signals
* **Backtesting Layer**: Backtester simulates trades based on agent signals
* **Analysis Layer**: Tools for analyzing and visualizing backtest results
* **Configuration Layer**: YAML files for configuring the system

The system follows a modular design where each component has a specific responsibility:
1. Data Manager: Responsible for fetching, cleaning, and preparing data
2. Agents: Analyze data and generate trading signals
3. Backtester: Simulates trades based on signals and calculates performance metrics
4. Configuration: Allows customization of parameters without code changes
