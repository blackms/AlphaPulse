## System Architecture

The AI Hedge Fund system implements a multi-agent trading architecture with four main layers:
1. Input Layer (Specialized Agents)
2. Risk Management Layer
3. Portfolio Management Layer
4. Output Layer (Trading Actions)

## Current Focus Areas

The current focus appears to be on reinforcement learning (RL) for trading, with specific attention to:
- RL model training and configuration
- Feature engineering for RL models
- Exchange integration (particularly Binance)
- Trading environment implementation

## Memory Bank Structure

This Memory Bank contains the following core files:

1. **productContext.md** (this file): Project overview, goals, and key components
2. **activeContext.md**: Current session context and what we're working on
3. **progress.md**: Track progress and next steps
4. **decisionLog.md**: Document key architectural decisions
5. **systemPatterns.md**: Document system patterns and design principles

Additional files may be created as needed to document specific aspects of the project.
