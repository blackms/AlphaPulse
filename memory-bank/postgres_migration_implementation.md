# PostgreSQL Migration Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for migrating the AlphaPulse backend to use PostgreSQL exclusively, removing SQLite support.

## Changes Made

### Database Configuration
- Updated `config/database_config.yaml` to use the correct PostgreSQL credentials:
  - Username: alessio
  - Password: (empty)
  - Database: alphapulse

### Connection Module
- Updated `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/database/connection.py` to use the correct PostgreSQL connection parameters:
  - Changed DEFAULT_DB_USER from "testuser" to "alessio"
  - Changed DEFAULT_DB_PASS from "testpassword" to "" (empty string)

### Repository Module
- Updated `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/database/repository.py` to use the direct PostgreSQL connection functions:
  - Changed import from `connection_manager` to `get_pg_connection`
  - Updated all instances of `connection_manager.get_pg_connection()` to `get_pg_connection()`
  - Changed `execute_with_retry` import to use the function from the connection module

### Connection Manager
- Updated `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/database/connection_manager.py` to handle PostgreSQL connections more robustly:
  - Added proper Pool type import from asyncpg.pool
  - Added a helper function `is_pool_closed()` to safely check if a pool is closed
  - Updated all pool.is_closed() calls to use the safer is_pool_closed() function
  - Improved connection release handling with better logging
  - Added better error handling for closed pools

## Run Scripts
- Updated `run_api_postgres.sh` to use the correct database user

## Benefits
1. Simplified database architecture by standardizing on PostgreSQL
2. Improved connection handling and error recovery
3. Better support for concurrent operations
4. Eliminated SQLite-specific code paths

## Next Steps
1. Test the application with PostgreSQL in various scenarios
2. Update documentation to reflect PostgreSQL-only support
3. Remove any remaining SQLite-specific code
4. Consider adding database migration scripts for users upgrading from SQLite
5. Fix Bybit API integration issues (unrelated to PostgreSQL migration):
   - The error "bybit.fetch_open_orders() got an unexpected keyword argument 'category'" needs to be addressed in the exchange adapter
   - The error "'BybitExchange' object has no attribute 'get_orders'" indicates a missing method in the BybitExchange class that needs to be implemented
