# PostgreSQL Migration Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for migrating the AlphaPulse system to use PostgreSQL exclusively, removing SQLite support.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `get_orders` Method to BybitExchange
- Implemented the missing `get_orders` method in the `BybitExchange` class
- Method leverages the existing `_get_bybit_order_history` method from the CCXTAdapter
- Handles multiple symbol formats to maximize success rate
- Implements proper error handling and logging
- Returns empty list instead of raising exceptions on failure

### 2. Fixed Connection Pool Management
- Improved connection release logic in `connection_manager.py`
- Added additional null checks to prevent NullPointerExceptions
- Refactored connection status logging for better diagnostics
- Extracted connection status variables for cleaner code

### 3. Database Configuration
- Updated configuration to use PostgreSQL exclusively
- Removed SQLite-specific code and dependencies
- Ensured all database operations use PostgreSQL-compatible SQL syntax

## Testing
- Verified that the API can run with PostgreSQL using the `run_api_postgres.sh` script
- Confirmed that data synchronization works correctly with the new implementation
- Validated that connection pool management properly handles closed connections

## Benefits
- Improved scalability with PostgreSQL's advanced features
- Better concurrency handling with proper connection pooling
- More robust transaction management
- Support for more complex queries and data types

## Next Steps
- Remove any remaining SQLite-specific scripts or configuration
- Update documentation to reflect PostgreSQL-only support
- Consider adding database migration scripts for users upgrading from SQLite
