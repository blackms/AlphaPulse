# System Patterns

This file documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project.
2025-04-07 02:21:35 - Initial creation of Memory Bank.

## Coding Patterns

* **Agent Pattern**: All trading agents inherit from BaseTradeAgent and implement the generate_signals method
* **Data Container Pattern**: MarketData, TradeSignal, and other dataclasses are used to pass structured data between components
* **Async/Await Pattern**: Asynchronous programming is used for agent initialization and signal generation
* **Configuration Pattern**: YAML files are used for configuration, with sensible defaults in code
* **Logging Pattern**: Each component has its own logger with appropriate log levels
* **Error Handling Pattern**: Try/except blocks with detailed error logging
* **Caching Pattern**: Data is cached to avoid redundant API calls

## Architectural Patterns

* **Multi-Agent System**: Multiple specialized agents collaborate to generate trading signals
* **Pipeline Architecture**: Data flows through distinct stages (fetch → prepare → analyze → trade → evaluate)
* **Event-Driven Simulation**: The backtester simulates market events day by day
* **Strategy Pattern**: Different trading strategies are encapsulated in agent implementations
* **Repository Pattern**: DataManager acts as a repository for market data
* **Factory Pattern**: Agents are created based on configuration

## Testing Patterns

* **Backtesting**: Historical data is used to simulate trading and evaluate performance
* **Benchmark Comparison**: Strategy performance is compared against benchmark strategies
* **Walk-Forward Analysis**: Training on one period and testing on another (currently disabled)
* **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Multiple simulations with varying parameters (currently disabled)
* **Sensitivity Analysis**: Testing how changes in parameters affect performance (currently disabled)
