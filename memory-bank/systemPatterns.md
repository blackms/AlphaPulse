# System Patterns

This document outlines the key architectural patterns, design principles, and coding conventions used in the AlphaPulse project.

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Multi-Layer Architecture

The system is organized into four main layers:
1. **Input Layer** (Specialized Agents) - Responsible for signal generation
2. **Risk Management Layer** - Handles risk assessment and position sizing
3. **Portfolio Management Layer** - Manages portfolio allocation and rebalancing
4. **Output Layer** (Trading Actions) - Executes trading decisions

This layered approach provides clear separation of concerns and allows each layer to focus on its specific responsibilities.

### 2. Factory Pattern

Used extensively for creating instances of complex objects:
- `ExchangeFactory` for creating exchange instances
- `AgentFactory` for creating trading agents

This pattern centralizes object creation logic and provides a consistent interface for creating different implementations.

### 3. Adapter Pattern

Used to provide a consistent interface to different external systems:
- `CCXTAdapter` provides a unified interface to different cryptocurrency exchanges
- Data provider adapters normalize data from different sources

This pattern allows the system to work with diverse external systems through a standardized interface.

### 4. Strategy Pattern

Used for implementing interchangeable algorithms:
- Portfolio optimization strategies (Black-Litterman, HRP, MPT)
- Trading strategies
- Risk management strategies

This pattern allows algorithms to be selected at runtime and easily swapped.

### 5. Repository Pattern

Used for data access abstraction:
- `SQLAlchemyStorage` for database access
- Data fetchers for external API access

This pattern separates data access logic from business logic.

## Design Principles

### 1. Dependency Injection

Components receive their dependencies through constructors or methods rather than creating them directly:
```python
def __init__(self, exchange: BaseExchange, risk_manager: RiskManager):
    self.exchange = exchange
    self.risk_manager = risk_manager
```

This approach improves testability and flexibility.

### 2. Configuration-Driven Design

System behavior is controlled through configuration rather than hard-coded values:
```python
config = ExperimentConfig.from_yaml("examples/trading/rl_config.yaml")
```

This allows for easy adjustment of system parameters without code changes.

### 3. Async-First Approach

Asynchronous programming is used throughout the system for improved performance:
```python
async def fetch_historical_data(symbol: str, days: int = 365) -> MarketData:
    # Async implementation
```

This allows for efficient handling of I/O-bound operations like API calls.

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling

Robust error handling with specific exception types and graceful degradation:
```python
try:
    # Operation that might fail
except MarketDataError as e:
    logger.error(f"Market data error: {e}")
    # Fallback strategy
```

### 5. Extensive Logging

Detailed logging throughout the system for monitoring and debugging:
```python
logger.info(f"Creating {exchange_type} exchange instance")
```

## Code Organization

### 1. Module Structure

The codebase is organized into functional modules:
- `agents` - Trading agents and signal generation
- `data_pipeline` - Data fetching and processing
- `exchanges` - Exchange integration
- `portfolio` - Portfolio management
- `risk_management` - Risk assessment and control
- `rl` - Reinforcement learning
- `hedging` - Hedging strategies
- `execution` - Order execution

### 2. Interface-Based Design

Interfaces define contracts that implementations must fulfill:
```python
class BaseExchange(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def fetch_ohlcv(self, symbol: str, timeframe: str, since: int, limit: int) -> List[OHLCV]:
        pass
```

This promotes loose coupling and allows for multiple implementations.

### 3. Type Annotations

Type hints are used throughout the codebase:
```python
def calculate_features(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```

This improves code readability, IDE support, and enables static type checking.

## Testing Patterns

### 1. Fixture-Based Testing

Test fixtures are used to set up test environments:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_exchange():
    # Create mock exchange
```

### 2. Mocking External Dependencies

External dependencies are mocked for unit testing:
```python
@patch('alpha_pulse.exchanges.factories.ExchangeRegistry.get_implementation')
def test_create_exchange(mock_get_implementation):
    # Test with mocked dependency
```

### 3. Parameterized Testing

Tests are parameterized to cover multiple scenarios:
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("exchange_type", [ExchangeType.BINANCE, ExchangeType.BYBIT])
def test_multiple_exchanges(exchange_type):
    # Test with different exchange types
