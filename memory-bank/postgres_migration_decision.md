# PostgreSQL Migration Decision

## Context

AlphaPulse currently supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases through abstraction layers in the database connection modules. SQLite support was initially included for development simplicity and local testing, but has several limitations for production use in a trading system.

## Problem

Maintaining dual database support increases:
- Code complexity and maintenance burden
- Testing requirements (each feature must be tested against both database engines)
- Potential for subtle bugs due to differences in SQL dialect and transaction behavior
- Documentation complexity for users and developers

From an architectural perspective, SQLite introduces limitations for a trading system:
- Lacks robust concurrency support for multi-process/multi-thread operations
- Limited support for complex SQL operations and functions
- Performance limitations for high-frequency data operations
- No built-in network access for distributed deployments

## Decision

We will remove SQLite support and standardize exclusively on PostgreSQL for AlphaPulse. This decision applies to:
- Database connection management
- Schema definitions
- Query operations
- Documentation
- Development environment setup
- Testing infrastructure

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Codebase**:
   - Remove conditional logic for different database engines
   - Eliminate dual codepaths for database operations
   - Enable PostgreSQL-specific optimizations

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Optimize for PostgreSQL's strengths
   - Utilize advanced PostgreSQL features (JSON support, indexing options, etc.)
   - Better connection pooling specifically for PostgreSQL

3. **Improved Reliability**:
   - Consistent behavior in all environments
   - Single database engine to monitor and maintain
   - Better error detection and handling

4. **Reduced Development Overhead**:
   - Simpler testing requirements
   - Streamlined deployment configurations
   - Clearer documentation

## Transition Plan

1. **Code Changes**:
   - Remove SQLite imports and dependencies
   - Update connection managers to focus solely on PostgreSQL
   - Eliminate DB_TYPE environment variable checks
   - Clean up SQLite-specific configuration

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update installation guides to focus on PostgreSQL setup
   - Provide migration guidance for existing SQLite users
   - Clarify PostgreSQL requirements in system documentation

3. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Update test suites to use PostgreSQL exclusively
   - Enhance PostgreSQL-specific test coverage
   - Verify all database operations with PostgreSQL

## Implementation Timeline

1. Immediate: Document architecture changes and update memory bank
2. Short-term: Implement code changes to remove SQLite support
3. Mid-term: Update all tests to use PostgreSQL exclusively
4. Long-term: Optimize database operations for PostgreSQL-specific features
