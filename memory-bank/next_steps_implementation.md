# Dashboard Frontend Implementation - Phase 3 Plan

## Overview

With Phases 1 and 2 complete, we now have a functional dashboard frontend with real-time data visualization and core widgets. Phase 3 will focus on implementing additional detail pages, enhancing analytics capabilities, and finalizing the integration with the backend.

## Timeline

- **Day 1-2**: Portfolio Detail Page
- **Day 3-4**: Trade History Page
- **Day 5-6**: Alerts Management Page
- **Day 7-8**: System Configuration Page
- **Day 9-10**: Testing and Optimization

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Portfolio Detail Page

#### Components to Implement:

- **PortfolioHeader**: Summary metrics, performance indicators, and allocation overview
- **PositionTable**: Sortable, filterable table of all positions with performance metrics
- **PositionDetail**: Modal/drawer with detailed information about a selected position
- **AllocationChart**: Advanced visualization of portfolio allocation (by asset class, sector, etc.)
- **PerformanceAnalytics**: Charts for historical performance, drawdowns, and volatility

#### Data Requirements:

- Historical portfolio performance data
- Detailed position information
- Risk metrics for each position
- Historical allocation data

#### Integration Points:

- Portfolio API endpoints (`GET /api/v1/portfolio`, `GET /api/v1/portfolio/positions`)
- WebSocket subscription for real-time updates

### 2. Trade History Page

#### Components to Implement:

- **TradeFilters**: Date range, asset, trade type, and status filters
- **TradeTable**: Sortable, filterable table of all trades with execution details
- **TradeDetail**: Modal/drawer with detailed information about a selected trade
- **TradeAnalytics**: Charts for trade performance, win/loss ratio, and P&L distribution
- **TradeTimeline**: Visual timeline of trade activity

#### Data Requirements:

- Historical trade data with execution details
- Performance metrics for each trade
- Signal source information

#### Integration Points:

- Trade API endpoints (`GET /api/v1/trades`, `GET /api/v1/trades/{trade_id}`)
- WebSocket subscription for real-time updates

### 3. Alerts Management Page

#### Components to Implement:

- **AlertFilters**: Severity, source, status, and date filters
- **AlertTable**: Sortable, filterable table of all alerts
- **AlertDetail**: Modal/drawer with detailed information about a selected alert
- **AlertTimeline**: Visual timeline of alert activity
- **AlertConfiguration**: Interface for configuring alert thresholds and notification settings

#### Data Requirements:

- Historical alert data
- Alert configuration options
- System health data related to alerts

#### Integration Points:

- Alert API endpoints (`GET /api/v1/alerts`, `POST /api/v1/alerts/{alert_id}/acknowledge`)
- WebSocket subscription for real-time updates
- Alert configuration endpoints (to be implemented)

### 4. System Configuration Page

#### Components to Implement:

- **SystemOverview**: Summary of system components and status
- **ComponentConfiguration**: Interface for configuring system components
- **AgentSettings**: Controls for individual trading agents
- **RiskParameters**: Interface for adjusting risk management parameters
- **BacktestRunner**: Interface for running and viewing backtest results

#### Data Requirements:

- System configuration data
- Component status and health metrics
- Backtest results data

#### Integration Points:

- System API endpoints (`GET /api/v1/system`, `GET /api/v1/system/components`)
- Configuration endpoints (to be implemented)
- Backtest API endpoints (to be implemented)

## Technical Considerations

### State Management Enhancements

- Implement caching for API responses
- Add pagination support for large datasets
- Optimize WebSocket subscription management

### Performance Optimizations

- Implement code-splitting for route-based components
- Add virtualization for large data tables
- Optimize chart rendering for large datasets

### Cross-cutting Concerns

- Enhance error handling and recovery
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Add analytics tracking (if required)
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test all new components with Jest and React Testing Library
- Ensure at least 80% code coverage for new components

### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components
- Verify state management and data flow

### End-to-End Tests

- Create Cypress tests for critical user journeys
- Test WebSocket reconnection scenarios

## Documentation

- Update component documentation with new additions
- Create user guide for each new page
- Document integration points for future reference

## Completion Criteria

Phase 3 will be considered complete when:

1. All planned pages are implemented and functional
2. Integration with the backend API is complete
3. Real-time updates via WebSockets are working
4. All tests are passing with minimum 80% coverage
5. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
6. The application is responsive on all device sizes

## Open Questions and Risks

1. **Backend Readiness**: Are all required backend endpoints implemented and tested?
2. **Data Volume**: How will the UI handle very large datasets (e.g., thousands of trades)?
3. **Performance**: Are there potential performance bottlenecks with real-time updates?
4. **Configuration Security**: How should we handle sensitive configuration parameters?

These questions should be addressed during the implementation of Phase 3.
