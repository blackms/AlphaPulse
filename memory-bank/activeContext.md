# Active Context: Dashboard Backend Testing Implementation

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented comprehensive test suites for the Dashboard Backend API. The implementation includes:

1. **API Endpoint Tests**
   - Metrics API tests (GET /api/v1/metrics/{metric_type}, GET /api/v1/metrics/{metric_type}/latest)
   - Alerts API tests (GET /api/v1/alerts, POST /api/v1/alerts/{alert_id}/acknowledge)
   - Portfolio API tests (GET /api/v1/portfolio)
   - Trades API tests (GET /api/v1/trades)
   - System API tests (GET /api/v1/system)

2. **WebSocket Tests**
   - WebSocket connection tests for all channels (metrics, alerts, portfolio, trades)
   - Authentication tests for WebSocket connections
   - Message broadcasting tests
   - Disconnection handling tests

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Shared fixtures for authentication, users, and common data
   - Test script for running API tests with various options
   - Integration with pytest for test discovery and execution

## Current Focus

We are now ready to run the tests and fix any issues that arise. After that, we will proceed with documentation and production readiness tasks.

## Next Steps

1. **Run Tests and Fix Issues**
   - Execute the test suite using the run_api_tests.py script
   - Fix any failing tests
   - Ensure all tests pass consistently

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Create integration tests with actual database connections
   - Test with real data pipelines
   - Verify end-to-end functionality

3. **Implement Performance Benchmarks**
   - Measure API response times
   - Test WebSocket performance with multiple clients
   - Optimize bottlenecks

4. **Documentation**
   - Add OpenAPI/Swagger annotations to API endpoints
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Document authentication and authorization flows

5. **Production Readiness**
   - Enhance error handling and logging
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add health checks and monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Test Structure
- Tests are organized by API endpoint type (metrics, alerts, portfolio, trades, system)
- Each test file focuses on a specific API area
- Shared fixtures are in conftest.py
- WebSocket tests are in a separate file due to their unique requirements

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests with mocked dependencies
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Performance testing for large datasets

### Test Execution
- Tests can be run using the run_api_tests.py script
- Options for filtering, coverage reporting, and HTML reports
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Dependencies and Integrations

The tests depend on the following components:

- FastAPI TestClient for HTTP endpoint testing
- pytest and pytest-asyncio for test execution
- WebSockets library for WebSocket testing
- Mock libraries for dependency isolation

## Notes and Decisions

- We've implemented comprehensive mocking to isolate tests from external dependencies
- WebSocket testing requires special handling due to their asynchronous nature
- We've included performance tests to ensure the API can handle large datasets
- The test structure follows the same organization as the API endpoints for clarity
