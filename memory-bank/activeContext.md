# Active Context: Dashboard Frontend Implementation

## Current Status

We have successfully completed Phases 1 and 2 of the Dashboard Frontend implementation:

1. **Phase 1: Project Structure and Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up project structure with directories for components, pages, services, hooks, and store
   - Implemented Redux store with middleware for API and WebSocket communication
   - Created authentication service and API client with token refresh
   - Set up WebSocket client for real-time updates
   - Built main layout and basic routing

2. **Phase 2: Dashboard Page and Core Components**
   - Implemented data visualization components (LineChart, BarChart, PieChart)
   - Created dashboard widgets (MetricCard, AlertsWidget, PortfolioSummaryWidget, etc.)
   - Built comprehensive dashboard page with real-time data visualization
   - Integrated WebSocket for live updates
   - Added responsive design for all device sizes

## Current Focus

We are now preparing for Phase 3 of the Dashboard Frontend implementation, which will focus on building detailed pages, enhancing analytics capabilities, and finalizing the integration with the backend.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Portfolio Detail Page**
   - Create PositionTable component for viewing all positions
   - Build detailed position view with historical performance
   - Implement advanced allocation charts
   - Add performance analytics

2. **Build Trade History Page**
   - Implement TradeFilters component
   - Create TradeTable with sorting and filtering
   - Build TradeDetail view with execution information
   - Add trade analytics and timeline visualization

3. **Develop Alerts Management Page**
   - Create AlertFilters component
   - Build AlertTable with sorting and filtering
   - Implement alert configuration interface
   - Add alert timeline visualization

4. **Create System Configuration Page**
   - Build SystemOverview component
   - Implement component configuration interfaces
   - Create agent settings controls
   - Add risk parameter adjustment interface

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
- Components follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- Widgets are composed of multiple smaller components
- Charts are abstracted to support different data types
- Shared UI components for consistency

### State Management
- Redux for global state (authentication, app settings)
- React Query for API data fetching and caching
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Local state for component-specific UI state

### Data Visualization
- Chart.js for performance and flexibility
- Responsive charts that adapt to container size
- Consistent theming across all visualizations
- Proper handling of loading, error, and empty states

## Dependencies and Integrations

The frontend depends on the following components:

- React.js and TypeScript for core functionality
- Material UI for component library
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Redux for state management
- React Query for data fetching
- WebSocket API for real-time updates
- REST API for data access and configuration

## Notes and Decisions

- We've implemented a feature verification process to ensure all requirements are met
- The dashboard uses a modular approach to support future extensions
- Real-time updates are prioritized for critical components
- Data visualization components are designed to handle large datasets efficiently
- We're following a phased approach to ensure stable, incremental progress
