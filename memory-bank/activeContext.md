## Current Focus

* The project is now focused on implementing a new long/short trading strategy for the S&P 500 with weekly or monthly rebalancing.
* The new strategy combines trend-following, mean reversion, and optional ML signals to decide whether to be long, short, or neutral in each period.
* The strategy will use multiple indicators including moving averages, RSI, volatility measures, and potentially ML models.
* The implementation will include position sizing, risk management, and backtesting components.
* The implementation of the long/short trading strategy has been completed with the following components:
  - Data Handler for fetching and processing S&P 500 and VIX data
  - Indicator calculations (40-week MA, 14-period RSI, VIX-based volatility regime)
  - Signal Generator for combining trend-following, mean reversion, and volatility signals
  - Position Manager for determining position direction and size
  - Risk Manager for implementing stop-loss and drawdown controls
  - Integration with the existing Backtester


* The project is currently focused on backtesting the S&P 500 index using a multi-agent approach.
* The backtest is configured to run from 2021-01-01 to 2022-12-31 (a 2-year period).
* Currently, only the technical and sentiment agents are enabled (fundamental agent is disabled).
* The technical agent uses a moving average crossover strategy (SMA50/SMA200).
* The sentiment agent analyzes news sentiment to generate trading signals.

## Recent Changes

* The backtest configuration has been modified to use a reduced time period (2021-2022) instead of the full 2010-2023 range.
* The agent weights have been adjusted: technical (0.5) and sentiment (0.5).
* Some validation features (walk-forward analysis, Monte Carlo simulations) have been disabled for initial testing.
* What are the optimal parameters for the strategy (MA period, RSI thresholds, VIX thresholds)?
* How does the strategy perform in different market regimes (bull, bear, sideways)?
* What is the impact of rebalancing frequency (weekly vs. monthly) on performance?
* How effective are the risk management rules in limiting drawdowns?
* What additional indicators or signals could improve the strategy's performance?


## Open Questions/Issues

* How effective is the current agent configuration in generating profitable trading signals?
* Should the fundamental agent be enabled to potentially improve performance?
* Are there any data quality issues that need to be addressed?
* What additional metrics or visualizations would be helpful for analyzing backtest results?
* How does the performance compare to benchmark strategies (buy-and-hold, balanced 60/40, etc.)?
