# Active Context: Dashboard Backend Implementation

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented Phase 1 of the Dashboard Backend according to our implementation plan. The implementation includes:

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Enhanced API configuration with JWT, API keys, rate limiting, and caching
   - Authentication and authorization with role-based permissions
   - Middleware for logging, rate limiting, and CORS

2. **Data Access Layer**
   - Metrics data access with caching
   - Alerts data with acknowledgment support
   - Portfolio data with position details
   - Trade history access
   - System metrics collection

3. **API Endpoints**
   - REST endpoints for all data types
   - WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
   - Authentication for both REST and WebSocket connections

4. **Demo and Examples**
   - Demo script to showcase API functionality
   - Shell script to run the demo

## Current Focus
- Testing the implementation
- Documenting the API
- Preparing for integration with the frontend

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all components
   - Perform integration testing with the monitoring system
   - Test WebSocket performance with multiple clients

2. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation with Swagger UI
   - Document authentication and authorization flow
   - Create usage examples for frontend developers

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Implement connection pooling for database access
   - Add health checks and monitoring for the API itself

## Dependencies
- Monitoring system (completed)
- Alerting system (completed)
- Portfolio manager (existing component)
- Broker interface (existing component)

## Blockers
None currently identified.

## Notes
- The implementation follows the design documented in `dashboard_backend_design.md`
- All features required by the AI Hedge Fund documentation have been implemented
- The API structure is designed to be extensible for future enhancements
