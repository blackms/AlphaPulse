# Active Context

## Current Session Context
[February 26, 2025, 5:30 PM (Europe/Berlin, UTC+1:00)]

## Current Focus

The current session is focused on understanding and potentially enhancing the reinforcement learning (RL) trading capabilities of AlphaPulse. Based on the open files in the VSCode environment, the focus appears to be on:

1. **RL Trading Implementation**: 
   - `examples/trading/demo_rl_trading.py` - Advanced RL trading system demonstration
   - `examples/trading/rl_config.yaml` - Configuration for RL models

2. **Feature Engineering for RL**:
   - `src/alpha_pulse/rl/features.py` - Feature engineering for RL trading

3. **Exchange Integration**:
   - `src/alpha_pulse/exchanges/factories.py` - Exchange factory implementations
   - `src/alpha_pulse/exchanges/implementations/binance.py` - Binance exchange implementation

## Key Components Under Review

### RL Trading System
The RL trading system in AlphaPulse uses:
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) as the default algorithm
- A sophisticated feature engineering pipeline with technical indicators, wavelet features, and market cipher features
- Configurable environment parameters for risk management (stop-loss, take-profit)
- Model checkpointing and evaluation capabilities

### Feature Engineering
The feature engineering module (`FeatureEngineer` class) provides:
- Basic price and volume features
- Trend indicators (Moving averages, MACD, ADX, Ichimoku Cloud)
- Momentum indicators (RSI, Stochastic, CCI, ROC, Williams %R)
- Volatility indicators (ATR, Bollinger Bands)
- Volume indicators (OBV, Chaikin Money Flow)
- Advanced features (Wavelet transform, Market Cipher inspired features)

### Exchange Integration
The exchange integration uses:
- Factory pattern for creating exchange instances
- Registry for exchange implementations
- CCXT adapter for standardized exchange API access
- Specialized implementations for specific exchanges (e.g., Binance)

## Open Questions

1. Are there opportunities to enhance the RL model's performance?
2. Could additional features improve trading decisions?
3. Are there optimizations needed for the exchange integration?
4. How does the current implementation handle market volatility?
5. What metrics are most important for evaluating the RL model's performance?

## Next Steps

Potential next steps based on the current context:
1. Review the RL model architecture and configuration
2. Analyze the feature engineering pipeline for potential improvements
3. Evaluate the exchange integration for robustness and error handling
4. Consider enhancements to the trading environment
5. Explore performance optimization opportunities
