## Current Task (2025-03-08)

**Task**: Fix error in exchange synchronization startup

**Error Message**:
```
2025-03-08 15:11:38.535 | ERROR    | alpha_pulse.data_pipeline.api_integration:startup_exchange_sync:37 - Error during exchange synchronization startup: 'ExchangeDataSynchronizer' object has no attribute 'initialize'
```

**Issue Analysis**:
- The error occurs in the `startup_exchange_sync` function in `api_integration.py`
- The system is trying to call an `initialize` method on the `ExchangeDataSynchronizer` object
- This method doesn't exist, causing an AttributeError

**Solution Approach**:
1. Examine the `api_integration.py` file to locate the error
2. Implement graceful degradation to handle the missing method
3. Add appropriate error handling and logging
4. Update documentation to reflect the changes

**Implementation Status**: In progress

## Current Files

- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/api_integration.py`: Contains the error in the `startup_exchange_sync` function

## Error Handling Approach

We're implementing a graceful degradation pattern to handle the missing method. This approach:

1. Attempts to call the `initialize` method
2. Catches the AttributeError if the method doesn't exist
3. Logs a warning message
4. Allows the system to continue running without the initialization

This approach follows our error handling principles:
- Fail gracefully when non-critical components have issues
- Use specific exception handling (AttributeError)
- Provide informative logging
- Allow the system to continue operating with reduced functionality

## Documentation Updates

We've updated the following documentation:
- `decisionLog.md`: Added our decision about the error handling approach
- `systemPatterns.md`: Updated with the error handling patterns we're using
- `productContext.md`: Added information about our error handling approach
- `error_handling_patterns.md`: Created a new document detailing our error handling patterns

## Next Steps

1. Implement the fix in `api_integration.py`
2. Test the fix to ensure it resolves the error
3. Consider adding the missing `initialize` method to the `ExchangeDataSynchronizer` class
4. Update the progress.md file with the completed work
