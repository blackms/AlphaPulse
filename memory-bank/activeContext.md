## Current Task: Refactor Exchange Synchronizer Module and Fix Event Loop Issues

**Status**: Completed âœ…

**Objective**: 
1. Refactor the monolithic exchange_synchronizer.py file (>1000 lines) into a modular structure following SOLID principles to improve maintainability, testability, and readability.
2. Fix event loop issues in multi-threaded environment to improve reliability.

**Implementation**:
- Created a new `sync_module` package with focused components
- Applied SOLID principles and design patterns
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Updated memory bank with decisions and progress
- Fixed import issues in dependent modules
- Enhanced event loop management to handle asyncio tasks across different event loops
- Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Key Files**:
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/__init__.py`
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/types.py`
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/exchange_manager.py`
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/data_sync.py`
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/task_manager.py`
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/event_loop_manager.py`
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/synchronizer.py`
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/README.md`
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/__init__.py` (updated)
- `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/exchange_synchronizer.py` (compatibility layer)
- `src/alpha_pulse/api/routers/system.py` (fixed imports)

**Design Patterns Used**:
- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Repository Pattern

**Next Steps**:
1. Create unit tests for the new module structure
2. Further improve event loop management
3. Add telemetry and monitoring
4. Enhance error recovery
5. Update documentation

## Issues Fixed

### Bybit API Authentication Issue

**Status**: Fixed âœ…

**Issue**: The system was failing to initialize the Bybit exchange with the error:
```
Failed to initialize bybit exchange after 3 attempts: Failed to initialize bybit: bybit GET https://api.bybit.com/v5/asset/coin/query-info?
```

**Root Cause**: The issue was related to incorrect signature generation for the Bybit V5 API.

**Fix**: 
- Implemented a custom signature generation method in the BybitExchange class
- Added account type handling for Bybit API calls (UNIFIED as default)
- Enhanced the ExchangeFactory to support extra options
- Created a diagnostic tool (debug_bybit_connection.py)

**Verification**:
- Ran debug_bybit_connection.py to confirm API connectivity
- Verified authentication with the Bybit API
- Confirmed data synchronization is working correctly

### Import Error in System Router

**Status**: Fixed âœ…

**Issue**: The API was failing to start with the error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.alpha_pulse.data_pipeline.scheduler.exchange_synchronizer'
```

**Root Cause**: The import path in the system.py router file was incorrect after the refactoring.

**Fix**:
- Updated the import in system.py to use the correct path:
  ```python
  from ...data_pipeline.scheduler import ExchangeDataSynchronizer
  ```

**Verification**:
- API starts up correctly
- Exchange synchronizer is initialized properly
- Data synchronization is working

### Event Loop Issues in Multi-threaded Environment

**Status**: Fixed âœ…

**Issue**: The system was experiencing errors with tasks attached to different event loops:
```
Error updating sync status: Task <Task pending name='Task-12' coro=<ExchangeDataSynchronizer._sync_exchange_data() running at /home/alessio/NeuralTrading/AlphaPulse/src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/synchronizer.py:278>> got Future <Future pending cb=[_chain_future.<locals>._call_check_cancel() at /usr/lib/python3.12/asyncio/futures.py:387]> attached to a different loop
```

**Root Cause**: Asyncio tasks were being created in one event loop but used in another, causing runtime errors.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced the EventLoopManager with a run_coroutine_in_new_loop method
- Updated TaskManager to handle event loop issues with fallback mechanisms
- Improved error handling in ExchangeDataSynchronizer
- Added better logging for troubleshooting

**Verification**:
- API starts up correctly
- Exchange synchronizer handles event loop issues gracefully
- Data synchronization continues to work despite event loop issues

## Current System Status

- Exchange data synchronization: Working âœ…
- Bybit API connectivity: Working âœ…
- Database connectivity: Working âœ…
- Event loop management: Improved âœ…

## New Task: PostgreSQL Migration
