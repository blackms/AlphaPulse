## Issues Fixed

### Import Error After Removing Legacy Files

**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Issue**: The application failed to start after removing the legacy exchange_cache_fixed.py file:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'alpha_pulse.data_pipeline.database.exchange_cache_fixed'
```

**Root Cause**: The portfolio.py file was still importing the ExchangeCacheRepository from the deleted file.

**Fix**:
- Removed the import of ExchangeCacheRepository from portfolio.py
- The file was already using the new exchange_sync module, so no functional changes were needed

**Verification**:
- Application starts up successfully
- No import errors are reported

### Bybit API Authentication Issue

**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Issue**: The system was failing to initialize the Bybit exchange with the error:
```
Failed to initialize bybit exchange after 3 attempts: Failed to initialize bybit: bybit GET https://api.bybit.com/v5/asset/coin/query-info?
```

**Root Cause**: The issue was related to incorrect signature generation for the Bybit V5 API.

**Fix**: 
- Implemented a custom signature generation method in the BybitExchange class
- Added account type handling for Bybit API calls (UNIFIED as default)
- Enhanced the ExchangeFactory to support extra options
- Created a diagnostic tool (debug_bybit_connection.py)

**Verification**:
- Ran debug_bybit_connection.py to confirm API connectivity
- Verified authentication with the Bybit API
- Confirmed data synchronization is working correctly

### Import Error in System Router

**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Issue**: The API was failing to start with the error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.alpha_pulse.data_pipeline.scheduler.exchange_synchronizer'
```

**Root Cause**: The import path in the system.py router file was incorrect after the refactoring.

**Fix**:
- Updated the import in system.py to use the correct path:
  ```python
  from ...data_pipeline.scheduler import ExchangeDataSynchronizer
  ```

**Verification**:
- API starts up correctly
- Exchange synchronizer is initialized properly
- Data synchronization is working

### Event Loop Issues in Multi-threaded Environment

**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Issue**: The system was experiencing errors with tasks attached to different event loops:
```
Error updating sync status: Task <Task pending name='Task-12' coro=<ExchangeDataSynchronizer._sync_exchange_data() running at /home/alessio/NeuralTrading/AlphaPulse/src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/sync_module/synchronizer.py:278>> got Future <Future pending cb=[_chain_future.<locals>._call_check_cancel() at /usr/lib/python3.12/asyncio/futures.py:387]> attached to a different loop
```

**Root Cause**: Asyncio tasks were being created in one event loop but used in another, causing runtime errors.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced the EventLoopManager with a run_coroutine_in_new_loop method
- Updated TaskManager to handle event loop issues with fallback mechanisms
- Improved error handling in ExchangeDataSynchronizer
- Added better logging for troubleshooting

**Verification**:
- API starts up correctly
- Exchange synchronizer handles event loop issues gracefully
- Data synchronization continues to work despite event loop issues
