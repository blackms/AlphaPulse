# Error Handling Patterns in AlphaPulse

This document outlines the error handling patterns and strategies used in the AlphaPulse system, with specific examples and implementation guidelines.

## Core Error Handling Principles

1. **Fail Gracefully**: The system should continue functioning even when non-critical components fail
2. **Specific Exception Handling**: Catch only the exceptions you expect and can handle properly
3. **Informative Logging**: Provide detailed log messages for troubleshooting
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Implement strategies to recover from error conditions when possible

## Pattern: Graceful Degradation

### Description
When a non-critical feature or method is unavailable, the system continues to operate with reduced functionality rather than failing completely.

### Implementation Example
From `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/api_integration.py`:

```python
try:
    exchange_data_synchronizer.initialize()
    logger.info("Exchange data synchronizer initialized successfully")
except AttributeError:
    logger.warning("ExchangeDataSynchronizer does not have initialize method, continuing without initialization")
```

### When to Use
- For non-critical functionality where the system can continue operating without it
- When dealing with components that might change between versions
- For optional features that enhance but aren't required for core functionality

### Benefits
- Improves system resilience
- Reduces unexpected crashes
- Makes the system more adaptable to changes
- Provides better user experience

## Pattern: Specific Exception Handling

### Description
Catch specific exception types rather than using broad exception handlers, to ensure each error is handled appropriately.

### Implementation Example
```python
try:
    # Operation that might fail
except AttributeError:
    # Handle missing attribute specifically
    logger.warning("Attribute not found, using default behavior")
except ConnectionError:
    # Handle connection issues differently
    logger.error("Connection failed, retrying in 5 seconds")
    time.sleep(5)
    retry_operation()
```

### When to Use
- Always prefer specific exception types over generic ones
- When different error conditions require different handling strategies
- When you need to distinguish between expected and unexpected errors

### Benefits
- Prevents masking of unexpected errors
- Provides more precise error handling
- Makes the code more maintainable and easier to debug
- Follows Python best practices

## Pattern: Circuit Breaker

### Description
Temporarily disable operations that repeatedly fail to prevent cascading failures and allow the system to recover.

### Implementation Example
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, max_failures=3, reset_timeout=60):
        self.max_failures = max_failures
        self.reset_timeout = reset_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.circuit_open = False
        self.reset_time = 0
        
    async def execute(self, operation, fallback_result=None):
        # Check if circuit is open
        if self.circuit_open:
            if time.time() > self.reset_time:
                # Try to close the circuit
                self.circuit_open = False
                self.failure_count = 0
            else:
                # Circuit still open, return fallback
                return fallback_result
                
        try:
            # Execute the operation
            result = await operation()
            # Success, reset failure count
            self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            # Operation failed
            self.failure_count += 1
            logger.error(f"Operation failed: {str(e)}")
            
            # Check if we should open the circuit
            if self.failure_count >= self.max_failures:
                self.circuit_open = True
                self.reset_time = time.time() + self.reset_timeout
                logger.warning(f"Circuit breaker opened, will reset in {self.reset_timeout} seconds")
                
            return fallback_result
```

### When to Use
- For operations that interact with external systems (APIs, databases)
- When failures in one component could cascade to others
- For non-critical operations that can be temporarily disabled
- When you need to protect the system from overload during partial outages

### Benefits
- Prevents cascading failures
- Allows the system to recover automatically
- Reduces load on failing components
- Improves overall system stability

## Pattern: Retry with Backoff

### Description
Automatically retry failed operations with increasing delays between attempts.

### Implementation Example
```python
async def retry_with_backoff(operation, max_retries=3, initial_delay=1, backoff_factor=2):
    """Execute an operation with retry and exponential backoff."""
    retries = 0
    delay = initial_delay
    
    while retries < max_retries:
        try:
            return await operation()
        except (ConnectionError, TimeoutError) as e:
            retries += 1
            if retries >= max_retries:
                logger.error(f"Operation failed after {max_retries} retries: {str(e)}")
                raise
                
            logger.warning(f"Operation failed, retrying in {delay} seconds: {str(e)}")
            await asyncio.sleep(delay)
            delay *= backoff_factor  # Exponential backoff
```

### When to Use
- For network operations that might fail temporarily
- When interacting with rate-limited APIs
- For operations that might be affected by transient issues
- When automatic recovery is possible

### Benefits
- Improves resilience against temporary failures
- Reduces manual intervention
- Respects external systems with backoff strategy
- Provides clear logging of retry attempts

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Prioritize Critical Paths**:
   - Identify the most critical paths in your application
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for these paths first
   - Ensure core functionality has fallback mechanisms

2. **Log Effectively**:
   - Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warning, error)
   - Include relevant context in log messages
   - Log both the error and the recovery action
   - Consider structured logging for better analysis

3. **Test Error Conditions**:
   - Write tests that simulate error conditions
   - Verify that error handling works as expected
   - Test recovery mechanisms
   - Include error scenarios in integration tests

4. **Document Error Handling**:
   - Document expected error conditions
   - Explain recovery strategies
   - Provide troubleshooting guidance
   - Update documentation when error handling changes

## Applying These Patterns

When implementing error handling in AlphaPulse components:

1. Identify what can go wrong in the component
2. Determine the impact of each failure mode
3. Choose appropriate error handling patterns
4. Implement specific exception handling
5. Add detailed logging
6. Test error conditions thoroughly
7. Document the approach

By following these patterns consistently, we can build a more resilient and maintainable system that gracefully handles unexpected conditions.
