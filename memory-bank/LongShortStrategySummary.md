# Long/Short Trading Strategy Implementation Summary

## Strategy Overview

The proposed long/short trading strategy for the S&P 500 combines multiple signal types to determine market positioning:

1. **Trend-Following Component**: Uses a 40-week moving average to identify the primary market trend
2. **Mean Reversion Component**: Uses RSI to identify overbought/oversold conditions
3. **Volatility Component**: Uses VIX to adjust exposure based on market volatility
4. **Optional ML Component**: Uses machine learning to predict market direction

The strategy will rebalance weekly or monthly and includes comprehensive risk management with stop-loss, trailing stops, and drawdown controls.
