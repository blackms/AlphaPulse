# Dashboard Backend Status

## Current Status

Based on our code exploration, we've discovered that the Dashboard Backend is more advanced in implementation than we initially thought. The key findings are:

### Existing Implementation

1. **FastAPI Application**:
   - Basic application structure is in place
   - CORS middleware configured
   - Error handling implemented
   - Authentication endpoints available

2. **REST API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/v1/metrics/*` - Metrics data retrieval
   - `/api/v1/alerts/*` - Alert history and management
   - `/api/v1/portfolio/*` - Portfolio information
   - `/api/v1/trades/*` - Trade history
   - `/api/v1/system/*` - System metrics

3. **WebSocket Endpoints**:
   - `/ws/metrics` - Real-time metrics updates
   - `/ws/alerts` - Real-time alert notifications
   - `/ws/portfolio` - Real-time portfolio updates
   - `/ws/trades` - Real-time trade execution updates

4. **Authentication System**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Permission-based authorization
   - WebSocket authentication

5. **Data Access Layer**:
   - Abstractions for metrics, alerts, portfolio, and trades
   - Consistent interfaces for data retrieval

### Missing Components

Despite the advanced state of implementation, there are still some components to complete:

1. **Integration with New Alerting System**:
   - Connect the alert data accessor to our new alerting system
   - Update WebSocket alert notifications to use our alerting system

2. **Caching Layer Enhancements**:
   - Verify caching is working correctly for all endpoints
   - Optimize cache invalidation strategies

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Write integration tests for the API and alerting system
   - Update API documentation
   - Create usage examples

## Revised Implementation Plan

Given the current state of the Dashboard Backend, our implementation plan should be adjusted to focus on integration rather than development from scratch.

### 1. Integration Tasks (2-3 days)

1. **Alert System Integration** (1-1.5 days):
   - Update `src/alpha_pulse/api/data/alerts.py` to use our new alerting system
   - Connect WebSocket alert notifications to our alerting system
   - Test the API and WebSocket endpoints with our alerting system

2. **Caching Optimization** (0.5 day):
   - Review caching configuration
   - Optimize cache settings for alerts and metrics
   - Implement efficient cache invalidation

3. **Testing and Documentation** (1 day):
   - Write integration tests for the API and alerting system
   - Update API documentation
   - Create usage examples

### 2. Move to Frontend Development (Next Phase)

Once integration is complete, we can move to Task 1.5: Dashboard Frontend development, which will involve:

1. Create a React-based frontend application
2. Implement authentication and authorization UI
3. Build dashboard components for metrics, alerts, portfolio, and trades
4. Connect to the backend API and WebSocket endpoints
5. Implement real-time updates
6. Create responsive design
7. Add charts and visualizations
8. Test and document the frontend

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Review the alert data accessor implementation in `src/alpha_pulse/api/data/alerts.py`
2. Update it to use our new alerting system
3. Test the API endpoints to make sure they work with our alerting system
4. Update the WebSocket alert notifications to use our alerting system
5. Complete the integration of the alerting system with the dashboard backend
