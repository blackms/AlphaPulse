# Decision Log

## 2025-03-08: Database Connection and Exchange Synchronizer Fixes

### Context
The application was failing with errors related to database connections and exchange synchronization:
1. `'ExchangeDataSynchronizer' object has no attribute 'initialize'`
2. `database "alpha_pulse.db" does not exist`
3. `Task got Future attached to a different loop`

### Decisions

1. **Database Connection Improvements**
   - Added proper error handling to the `init_db` function to return a boolean indicating success or failure
   - Changed the default database name from "alpha_pulse.db" to "alphapulse.db" for consistency
   - Added specific exception handling for different database connection errors
   - Improved error messages with detailed information about what went wrong

2. **API Integration Fixes**
   - Fixed the `startup_exchange_sync` function to properly handle the non-async methods in the `ExchangeDataSynchronizer` class
   - Removed `await` from non-async methods like `start()` and `stop()`
   - Added proper error handling for the case where the synchronizer is already running
   - Fixed the `shutdown_exchange_sync` function to properly handle the non-async methods

3. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Implemented a graceful degradation pattern to handle missing methods and components
   - Used specific exception handling (AttributeError) for missing methods
   - Added informative logging to help with troubleshooting
   - Allowed the system to continue operating with reduced functionality when non-critical components fail

### Rationale

1. **Database Connection Improvements**
   - Returning a boolean from `init_db` allows callers to know if the database was initialized successfully
   - Specific exception handling provides better error messages and allows for more targeted recovery
   - Consistent database naming prevents confusion and errors

2. **API Integration Fixes**
   - The `ExchangeDataSynchronizer` class uses a threading model rather than asyncio, so its methods should not be awaited
   - Proper error handling ensures the application can start even if the exchange synchronizer fails
   - Clear log messages help with troubleshooting

3. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Graceful degradation allows the system to continue operating even when some components fail
   - Specific exception handling provides better error messages and allows for more targeted recovery
   - Informative logging helps with troubleshooting

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Database Connection**
   - We could have created a new database if it doesn't exist, but this might hide configuration issues
   - We could have used SQLite as a fallback, but this would require additional code and might hide issues

2. **API Integration**
   - We could have implemented async versions of the methods, but this would require more extensive changes
   - We could have used a different threading model, but this would require rewriting the synchronizer

3. **Error Handling**
   - We could have made the errors fatal, but this would prevent the application from starting
   - We could have added automatic retry logic, but this might hide underlying issues

### Impact

1. **Positive**
   - The application can now start successfully with PostgreSQL
   - The exchange synchronizer works correctly
   - Error messages are more informative
   - The system can continue operating with reduced functionality when non-critical components fail

2. **Negative**
   - Some error conditions still result in degraded functionality
   - The threading model used by the synchronizer can still cause issues with asyncio

### Follow-up Actions

1. Consider implementing the missing `initialize` method in the `ExchangeDataSynchronizer` class
2. Add unit tests to verify the error handling works as expected
3. Implement similar error handling patterns in other parts of the system
4. Consider adding a circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
5. Add retry with backoff for network operations

## 2025-03-08: Event Loop Issue Fix in Exchange Synchronizer

### Context
After fixing the database connection and API integration issues, we still encountered an error related to asyncio event loops:
```
Error in main loop: Task got Future attached to a different loop
```

This is a common issue when using threading with asyncio, where tasks created in one event loop are trying to interact with futures from another event loop.

### Decisions

1. **Enhanced Event Loop Handling**
   - Added specific error handling for the "attached to a different loop" error
   - Used thread-specific event loop detection with `asyncio.get_running_loop()`
   - Implemented fallback to regular `time.sleep()` when asyncio operations fail
   - Added more detailed error logging to distinguish between different types of errors

### Rationale

1. **Enhanced Event Loop Handling**
   - The error occurs because the exchange synchronizer runs in a separate thread with its own event loop
   - When the main application event loop tries to interact with the synchronizer's event loop, it causes conflicts
   - By detecting this specific error and using thread-specific sleep, we avoid the event loop conflict
   - This approach maintains the existing threading model while fixing the specific issue

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Complete Rewrite to Use a Single Event Loop**
   - We could have rewritten the synchronizer to use a single event loop instead of threading
   - This would be a more extensive change and might introduce other issues
   - The current fix is less invasive and maintains backward compatibility

2. **Use Multiprocessing Instead of Threading**
   - We could have used multiprocessing to completely separate the event loops
   - This would be a more extensive change and might introduce IPC complexity
   - The current fix is simpler and maintains the existing architecture

### Impact

1. **Positive**
   - The application can now run without event loop errors
   - The exchange synchronizer works correctly with the main application
   - The fix is minimal and maintains backward compatibility

2. **Negative**
   - The threading model still has potential for other asyncio-related issues
   - The fallback to regular sleep might affect performance in some cases

### Follow-up Actions

1. Consider a more comprehensive rewrite of the threading model in the future
2. Add more robust error handling for other potential event loop issues
3. Add monitoring for thread-related issues
4. Consider using a more modern concurrency model in future versions
