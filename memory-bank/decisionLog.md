# Decision Log

This document tracks key architectural and implementation decisions made during the development of AlphaPulse.

## Database Decisions

### 2025-03-10: Remove Legacy Connection Manager and Database Pooling

**Context:**
The system was using a complex connection manager with pooling that was causing recurring issues with database connections, especially in multi-threaded environments. The connection manager was overly complex (700+ lines) and difficult to maintain.

**Decision:**
Remove the legacy connection manager and connection pooling in favor of simpler direct database connections.

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies the codebase by removing complex connection pooling logic
- Reduces the risk of connection-related issues like "connection has been released back to the pool"
- Improves reliability by using a simpler database connection approach
- Makes debugging easier with clearer error messages
- Aligns with the new exchange_sync module's design principles

**Implementation:**
- Removed `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/database/connection_manager.py`
- Removed `src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/database/connection_manager_fixed.py`
- Updated `exchange_cache_fixed.py` to use direct database connection
- Updated portfolio data accessor to use the new exchange_sync module
- Verified application runs successfully with the new implementation

**Consequences:**
- Simplified codebase with cleaner database access
- Improved reliability of database operations
- Reduced complexity in error handling and recovery
- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable code with smaller, focused components

### 2025-03-09: Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL exclusively

**Context:**
The system was previously supporting both SQLite and PostgreSQL as database backends. This dual support increased maintenance overhead and complexity in the codebase.

**Decision:**
Remove SQLite support entirely and standardize on PostgreSQL as the only supported database backend.

**Rationale:**
- PostgreSQL provides better scalability for production use
- Simplifies codebase by removing conditional logic for different database types
- Allows optimization of connection pooling and query patterns specifically for PostgreSQL
- Enables use of PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONB, array types, and advanced indexing
- Reduces testing matrix and maintenance burden

**Implementation:**
- Updated connection.py to remove SQLite-specific code
- Created run_api_postgres.sh to replace SQLite version
- Updated all launcher scripts to use PostgreSQL
- Implemented missing get_orders method in BybitExchange class
- Fixed connection pool management in connection_manager.py
- Improved connection release logic with better null checks
- Documented the change in memory-bank/postgres_migration_implementation.md

**Consequences:**
- Simplified codebase with single database target
- Development and testing environments now require PostgreSQL
- Deployment documentation needs to be updated to reflect PostgreSQL requirement
- Local development setup becomes slightly more complex (requires PostgreSQL installation)

## API Decisions

### 2025-03-10: Implement Loguru for Enhanced Logging in Exchange Sync Module

**Context:**
The exchange_sync module was using the standard Python logging module, which provides basic logging functionality but lacks advanced features like structured logging, automatic log rotation, and rich error tracebacks.

**Decision:**
Replace standard logging with loguru in the exchange_sync module to enhance logging capabilities.

**Rationale:**
- Provides more readable and colorized console output for better developer experience
- Enables structured log files with automatic rotation for production use
- Offers better error tracebacks with variable inspection for easier debugging
- Creates consistent logging format across all components
- Simplifies logging configuration with intuitive API
- Maintains backward compatibility while enhancing debugging capabilities

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Keep standard logging**: Continue using Python's built-in logging module. Rejected due to limited features and verbosity of configuration.
2. **Use structlog**: Another structured logging library. Rejected due to higher complexity compared to loguru.
3. **Use loguru (selected)**: Selected for its simplicity, rich features, and developer-friendly API.

**Implementation:**
- Replaced standard logging with loguru in repository.py
- Updated config.py with loguru configuration
- Integrated loguru in portfolio_service.py
- Implemented loguru in scheduler.py
- Converted exchange_client.py to use loguru
- Updated runner.py with loguru logging
- Modified exchange_sync_integration.py to use loguru
- Added comprehensive documentation in EXCHANGE_SYNC_INTEGRATION.md

**Consequences:**
- Improved developer experience with more readable logs
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with better error tracebacks
- More maintainable logging configuration
- Consistent logging format across all components
- Automatic log rotation for production use
- Slight increase in dependencies (added loguru)

### 2025-03-10: Integrate exchange_sync module into main application

**Context:**
The existing exchange data synchronization system had multiple issues including complex threading, connection pool management problems, scattered error handling, high coupling between components, and files exceeding 200 lines of code. A new `exchange_sync` module was developed to address these issues with a cleaner, more maintainable design.

**Decision:**
Refactor AlphaPulse by removing all legacy complex logic and integrating the new exchange_sync functionality directly into the main application.

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies the codebase by removing complex connection pooling and threading logic
- Improves reliability by using a simpler database connection approach
- Enhances maintainability with clear separation of concerns
- Reduces coupling between components
- Provides better error handling and logging
- Enables easier testing and debugging

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Keep the legacy system**: Continue using the existing complex system with incremental improvements. Rejected due to ongoing maintenance burden and complexity.
2. **Hybrid approach**: Use both systems in parallel during a transition period. Rejected due to increased complexity and potential for conflicts.
3. **Complete replacement (selected)**: Replace the legacy system entirely with the new exchange_sync module. Selected for clean implementation and reduced complexity.

**Implementation:**
- Created a new API integration module for the exchange_sync module
- Updated the main.py file to use the new module
- Updated the system.py router to use the new module
- Enhanced PortfolioDataAccessor with direct exchange_sync support
- Updated portfolio.py router to use the new integration
- Added comprehensive documentation in EXCHANGE_SYNC_INTEGRATION.md
- Removed legacy components:
  - Removed src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/api_integration.py
  - Removed src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler.py
  - Removed src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/scheduler/ directory
  - Removed src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/database/connection_manager.py
  - Removed src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/database/connection_manager_fixed.py

**Consequences:**
- Simplified codebase with cleaner architecture
- Improved reliability of exchange data synchronization
- Reduced complexity in error handling and recovery
- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable code with smaller, focused components
- Easier to extend with new exchanges or features

## Frontend Decisions

## Architecture Decisions

### 2025-03-10: Adopt Progressive Evolution Approach for System Refactoring

**Context:**
The AlphaPulse system has grown to approximately 150,000 lines of code with increasing complexity. A comprehensive architectural evaluation was conducted to determine the optimal refactoring strategy among several approaches: modular monolith, domain-driven design, hexagonal architecture, service-oriented architecture, and microservices.

**Decision:**
Implement a progressive evolution approach starting with a modular monolith incorporating domain-driven design principles, with selective adoption of hexagonal architecture patterns for external interface components.

**Rationale:**
- Maintains low latency critical for trading operations (no network boundaries)
- Provides clear module boundaries without distributed system complexity
- Simplifies transaction management across trading operations
- Supports incremental implementation without "big bang" rewrite risks
- Allows selective extraction of services in the future if needed
- Aligns well with the natural domains in the trading system
- More manageable learning curve for the team

**Implementation:**
- Documented evaluation in memory-bank/architectural_patterns_evaluation.md
- Created implementation strategy in memory-bank/refactoring_strategy_recommendations.md
- Defined a phased approach:
  1. Internal reorganization with clear module boundaries
  2. Domain model enhancement with DDD principles
  3. Port/adapter implementation for external interfaces
  4. Dashboard separation as a distinct service

**Consequences:**
- Required package reorganization and interface definition
- Need for additional testing to validate module boundaries
- Initial development slowdown during restructuring
- Improved maintainability and extensibility long-term
- Clearer ownership boundaries for team organization
- More explicit interfaces between components
- Better alignment with business domains

### 2025-03-10: Exchange Data Synchronization Redesign

**Context**: 
The current exchange data synchronization system has experienced recurring issues with database connections, threading/concurrency problems, and complex error handling. The debug logs show "connection has been released back to the pool" and "Result is not set" errors that occur despite multiple attempts to fix them. The complexity of the current implementation with pools, transactions, and multi-threaded access makes debugging difficult.

**Decision**: 
Completely redesign the exchange data synchronization module with a simplified architecture following SOLID principles, focusing on:

1. Simpler components with clear boundaries (< 200 lines per file)
2. Single-responsibility modules that are easier to test and debug
3. Elimination of complex connection pooling in favor of simpler per-operation connections
4. More robust error handling with clear logs
5. Running as a background process on a timer (every 30 minutes) instead of complex threading

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. *Continue patching the existing system*: While we've made progress with fixes, the fundamental design issues would likely continue to cause problems. The system has become too complex.

2. *Partial refactoring*: We could keep some components and rewrite others, but this would risk maintaining incompatible design approaches and wouldn't fully address the architectural issues.

3. *Complete redesign (selected)*: While requiring more upfront work, this provides a clean break from the problematic patterns and ensures a more maintainable system going forward.

**Implications**:

- Short-term development cost for the rewrite
- Cleaner architecture with clear responsibilities
- Improved maintainability and debugging experience
- Simplified error handling and recovery
- Reduced risk of connection-related issues

**Implementation Notes**: 
A detailed design document has been created in `memory-bank/exchange_sync_refactoring.md` outlining the new architecture, component responsibilities, and implementation approach. The system will use a clean domain model, repository pattern, and service layer with simple database connections.
