# Decision Log

This document tracks key architectural and design decisions made during the development of AlphaPulse.

## [February 26, 2025] - Memory Bank Initialization

**Context:** The AlphaPulse project has a complex architecture with multiple components and subsystems. There was a need to establish a structured way to maintain project context, track progress, and document architectural decisions.

**Decision:** Implemented a Memory Bank system with core files for tracking project context, active work, progress, decisions, and system patterns.

**Rationale:** The Memory Bank provides a centralized location for project documentation and context, making it easier to maintain continuity across development sessions and onboard new team members.

**Implementation:** Created the following core files:
- productContext.md - Project overview and key components
- activeContext.md - Current session focus and open questions
- progress.md - Work completed and next steps
- decisionLog.md - This file, for tracking decisions
- systemPatterns.md - Documentation of system patterns and principles

## [February 26, 2025] - Initial Architecture Analysis

**Context:** Initial review of the AlphaPulse system architecture revealed a sophisticated multi-layer design with specialized components for different aspects of trading.

**Decision:** Documented the current architecture in the Memory Bank, focusing on the RL trading system, feature engineering, and exchange integration components that appear to be the current focus.

**Rationale:** Understanding the current architecture is essential for making informed decisions about enhancements and optimizations.

**Implementation:** 
- Analyzed key files including demo_rl_trading.py, features.py, and exchange implementations
- Documented the architecture in productContext.md and activeContext.md
- Identified potential areas for improvement in progress.md

## [Historical Decisions Inferred from Codebase]

### Multi-Agent Trading System

**Context:** Trading requires multiple specialized strategies and perspectives.

**Decision:** Implemented a multi-agent system with specialized agents (Activist, Value, Fundamental, Sentiment, Technical, Valuation).

**Rationale:** Different market conditions and asset classes benefit from different analysis approaches. A multi-agent system allows for specialized expertise while aggregating signals for more robust decisions.

**Implementation:** Agent Manager coordinates multiple specialized agents, each with its own analysis approach.

### Reinforcement Learning for Trading

**Context:** Trading environments are complex, dynamic, and have delayed rewards.

**Decision:** Implemented a reinforcement learning approach for trading decisions.

**Rationale:** RL is well-suited for sequential decision-making problems with delayed rewards, which matches the trading domain. It can learn from experience and adapt to changing market conditions.

**Implementation:** 
- TradingEnv class implementing the RL environment
- Feature engineering pipeline for state representation
- PPO algorithm as the default RL approach

### Exchange Abstraction

**Context:** Need to support multiple exchanges with different APIs.

**Decision:** Implemented a factory pattern with adapter design for exchange integration.

**Rationale:** This approach provides a unified interface while allowing for exchange-specific implementations, making it easier to add new exchanges and maintain existing ones.

**Implementation:** 
- ExchangeFactory for creating exchange instances
- ExchangeRegistry for managing exchange implementations
- BaseExchange interface for standardized access
- CCXT adapter for common functionality
- Specialized implementations for specific exchanges
