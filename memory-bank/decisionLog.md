# Decision Log

## Dashboard Backend Implementation (2025-03-07)

### Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Implement both JWT token and API key authentication.
**Rationale**: 
- JWT tokens provide secure authentication for frontend users with role-based permissions
- API keys allow programmatic access for other services and scripts
- Supporting both methods provides flexibility for different client types

### Caching Implementation
**Decision**: Implement a dual-layer caching system with memory cache as default and Redis as an option.
**Rationale**:
- Memory cache is simple and requires no additional dependencies for basic deployments
- Redis option provides distributed caching for production deployments with multiple API instances
- Abstraction layer allows switching between implementations without changing application code

### Real-time Updates
**Decision**: Use WebSockets for real-time data updates.
**Rationale**:
- WebSockets provide full-duplex communication for real-time updates
- More efficient than polling for frequently changing data
- Allows push notifications for critical alerts
- Reduces server load compared to frequent REST API calls

### Data Access Layer
**Decision**: Create separate data accessor classes for each data type.
**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns for different data types
- Encapsulates data access logic and error handling
- Makes testing easier with mock implementations
- Allows for future optimization of specific data access patterns

### Permission System
**Decision**: Implement a role-based permission system.
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies access control with predefined roles (admin, operator, viewer)
- Granular permissions for different API endpoints
- Easily extensible for future permission requirements
- Consistent permission checks across REST and WebSocket endpoints

### API Structure
**Decision**: Organize API endpoints by data domain with versioning.
**Rationale**:
- Logical organization makes API easier to understand and document
- Versioning (v1) allows for future API changes without breaking existing clients
- Consistent URL structure across all endpoints
- Follows REST best practices

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Implement consistent error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes.
**Rationale**:
- Proper status codes help clients understand error conditions
- Consistent error format makes client-side handling easier
- Detailed error messages for developers while maintaining security
- Logging of errors for troubleshooting
