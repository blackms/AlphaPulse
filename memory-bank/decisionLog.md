# Decision Log

## 2025-03-08: Refactored Exchange Synchronizer Module

**Decision**: Refactored the monolithic `exchange_synchronizer.py` (>1000 lines) into a modular structure following SOLID principles.

**Rationale**:
- The original file was too large (>1000 lines), making it difficult to maintain and debug
- The monolithic design violated the Single Responsibility Principle
- The new modular design improves maintainability, testability, and readability
- Each component now has a clear, focused responsibility

**Implementation Details**:
1. Created a new `sync_module` package with the following components:
   - `types.py`: Defines data types and enums
   - `exchange_manager.py`: Handles exchange creation and initialization
   - `data_sync.py`: Handles data synchronization with exchanges
   - `task_manager.py`: Manages synchronization tasks and scheduling
   - `event_loop_manager.py`: Handles event loop management
   - `synchronizer.py`: Main orchestrator class

2. Applied design patterns:
   - Singleton Pattern for the ExchangeDataSynchronizer
   - Factory Pattern for exchange creation
   - Strategy Pattern for different synchronization strategies
   - Circuit Breaker Pattern for error handling
   - Repository Pattern for data access

3. Maintained backward compatibility:
   - Updated `scheduler/__init__.py` to use the new module
   - Created a compatibility layer in the original `exchange_synchronizer.py` file

**Benefits**:
- Improved code organization and readability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Improved testability
- Each file is now under 300 lines

**Drawbacks/Risks**:
- Increased complexity in the module structure
- Potential for circular imports if not careful
- Need to ensure backward compatibility

**Mitigation**:
- Added comprehensive documentation in README.md
- Used clear naming conventions
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Added deprecation warnings for the old implementation

## 2025-03-08: Improved Event Loop Management in Multi-threaded Environment

**Decision**: Enhanced the event loop management to handle asyncio tasks across different event loops.

**Rationale**:
- The system was experiencing errors with tasks attached to different event loops
- These errors were causing synchronization tasks to fail
- The application needed to be more resilient to event loop issues

**Implementation Details**:
1. Enhanced the `EventLoopManager` class:
   - Added a `run_coroutine_in_new_loop` method to run coroutines in isolated event loops
   - Improved error handling for event loop operations
   - Added better logging for event loop issues

2. Updated the `TaskManager` class:
   - Made the `update_sync_status` method more resilient to event loop issues
   - Added fallback mechanisms for database operations
   - Improved error handling and logging

3. Updated the `ExchangeDataSynchronizer` class:
   - Enhanced the `_sync_exchange_data` method to handle event loop issues
   - Added more robust error handling for status updates
   - Improved logging for troubleshooting

**Benefits**:
- More resilient synchronization process
- Better error handling and recovery
- Improved logging for troubleshooting
- Reduced likelihood of synchronization failures

**Drawbacks/Risks**:
- Increased complexity in the event loop management
- Potential for performance overhead with new event loops
- Need to ensure proper cleanup of event loops

**Mitigation**:
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Ensured proper cleanup of event loops
- Used thread-local storage for event loop management
- Added fallback mechanisms for critical operations
