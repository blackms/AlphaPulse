# Decision Log

## Dashboard Backend Implementation (2025-03-07)

### Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Implement both JWT token and API key authentication.
**Rationale**: 
- JWT tokens provide secure authentication for frontend users with role-based permissions
- API keys allow programmatic access for other services and scripts
- Supporting both methods provides flexibility for different client types

### Caching Implementation
**Decision**: Implement a dual-layer caching system with memory cache as default and Redis as an option.
**Rationale**:
- Memory cache is simple and requires no additional dependencies for basic deployments
- Redis option provides distributed caching for production deployments with multiple API instances
- Abstraction layer allows switching between implementations without changing application code

### Real-time Updates
**Decision**: Use WebSockets for real-time data updates.
**Rationale**:
- WebSockets provide full-duplex communication for real-time updates
- More efficient than polling for frequently changing data
- Allows push notifications for critical alerts
- Reduces server load compared to frequent REST API calls

### Data Access Layer
**Decision**: Create separate data accessor classes for each data type.
**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns for different data types
- Encapsulates data access logic and error handling
- Makes testing easier with mock implementations
- Allows for future optimization of specific data access patterns

### Permission System
**Decision**: Implement a role-based permission system.
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies access control with predefined roles (admin, operator, viewer)
- Granular permissions for different API endpoints
- Easily extensible for future permission requirements
- Consistent permission checks across REST and WebSocket endpoints

### API Structure
**Decision**: Organize API endpoints by data domain with versioning.
**Rationale**:
- Logical organization makes API easier to understand and document
- Versioning (v1) allows for future API changes without breaking existing clients
- Consistent URL structure across all endpoints
- Follows REST best practices

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Implement consistent error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes.
**Rationale**:
- Proper status codes help clients understand error conditions
- Consistent error format makes client-side handling easier
- Detailed error messages for developers while maintaining security
- Logging of errors for troubleshooting

## Dashboard Backend Testing Implementation (2025-03-07)

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive unit tests with mocked dependencies.
**Rationale**:
- Isolates tests from external dependencies for reliability
- Faster test execution without database or network dependencies
- Allows testing of edge cases and error conditions
- Easier to maintain and extend

### Test Organization
**Decision**: Organize tests by API endpoint type.
**Rationale**:
- Clear mapping between API endpoints and test files
- Makes it easier to find and update tests when endpoints change
- Logical organization for test discovery and execution
- Follows the same structure as the API implementation

### Shared Fixtures
**Decision**: Use shared fixtures in conftest.py for common test setup.
**Rationale**:
- Reduces code duplication across test files
- Ensures consistent test environment
- Makes tests more maintainable
- Follows pytest best practices

### WebSocket Testing
**Decision**: Implement specialized tests for WebSocket endpoints.
**Rationale**:
- WebSockets require different testing approaches than REST endpoints
- Asynchronous nature requires special handling
- Connection management and authentication need specific tests
- Real-time updates require specialized verification

### Performance Testing
**Decision**: Include performance tests for large datasets.
**Rationale**:
- Ensures API can handle realistic data volumes
- Identifies potential bottlenecks early
- Establishes performance baselines
- Helps with capacity planning

### Test Execution
**Decision**: Create a dedicated script for running API tests.
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies test execution with various options
- Provides consistent command-line interface
- Allows filtering and reporting options
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines

## Data Pipeline Error Handling (2025-03-08)

### Graceful Degradation for Missing Methods
**Decision**: Implement try-except blocks to handle missing methods in classes.
**Rationale**:
- Makes the system more robust against version mismatches
- Allows the application to continue running even when non-critical methods are missing
- Provides clear warning logs for troubleshooting
- Follows the principle of graceful degradation

### Specific Exception Handling
**Decision**: Catch specific exceptions (AttributeError) rather than generic exceptions.
**Rationale**:
- More precise error handling targets exactly the issue we're trying to solve
- Avoids masking other potential errors that should be handled differently
- Makes the code more maintainable and easier to debug
- Follows Python best practices for exception handling

### Informative Logging
**Decision**: Add detailed log messages for error conditions.
**Rationale**:
- Helps with troubleshooting by providing clear information about what went wrong
- Distinguishes between expected and unexpected error conditions
- Provides context for operators and developers
- Follows good logging practices
