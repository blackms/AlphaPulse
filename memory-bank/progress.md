* Implemented the long/short trading strategy for S&P 500

## Completed Tasks

* Set up the basic project structure with necessary modules (data_manager.py, backtester.py, agents)
* Implemented the DataManager for fetching and preparing data from various sources
* Implemented the Backtester for simulating trades based on agent signals
* Implemented the base agent class and specialized agents (technical, fundamental, sentiment)
* Created configuration files for the backtest
* Executed initial backtest with technical and sentiment agents
* Generated trade history and performance metrics

## Current Tasks

* Planning the implementation of a new long/short trading strategy for S&P 500
* Designing a strategy that combines trend-following, mean reversion, and optional ML signals
* Preparing to implement weekly/monthly rebalancing with position sizing and risk management

* Testing the implemented long/short strategy
* Analyzing the performance of the strategy
* Fine-tuning strategy parameters
* Documenting the implementation

* Analyzing the results of the initial backtest
* Evaluating the performance of the current agent configuration
* Identifying potential improvements to the trading strategies

## Next Steps

* Enable and test the fundamental agent to see if it improves performance
* Implement additional technical indicators for the technical agent
* Improve the sentiment analysis to better capture market sentiment
* Extend the backtest to a longer time period (2010-2023)
* Enable validation features (walk-forward analysis, Monte Carlo simulations)
* Compare performance against benchmark strategies
* Generate more detailed performance reports and visualizations
