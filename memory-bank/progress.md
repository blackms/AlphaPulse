# Implementation Progress

## Dashboard Backend (Task 1.4)

### Status: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

We have successfully implemented the first phase of the Dashboard Backend according to our implementation plan. The implementation includes:

1. **Enhanced API Configuration**
   - JWT and API key authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration
   - Caching support (memory and Redis)

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - API key validation
   - Role-based permissions system

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - Metrics data access with caching
   - Alerts data with acknowledgment support
   - Portfolio data with position details
   - Trade history access
   - System metrics collection

4. **REST API Endpoints**
   - Metrics endpoints with historical and latest data
   - Alerts endpoints with filtering and acknowledgment
   - Portfolio endpoint with optional history
   - Trades endpoint with filtering
   - System metrics endpoint

5. **WebSocket Support**
   - Real-time metrics updates
   - Real-time alerts notifications
   - Real-time portfolio updates
   - Real-time trade notifications
   - Connection management and authentication

6. **Example and Demo**
   - Created demo script to showcase API functionality
   - Added shell script to run the demo

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all components
   - Perform integration testing with the monitoring system
   - Test WebSocket performance with multiple clients

2. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation with Swagger UI
   - Document authentication and authorization flow
   - Create usage examples for frontend developers

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Implement connection pooling for database access
   - Add health checks and monitoring for the API itself

## Dashboard Frontend (Task 1.5)

### Status: Planning Complete ‚úÖ

The design for the Dashboard Frontend has been completed and documented in `dashboard_frontend_design.md`. Implementation will begin after the Dashboard Backend is fully tested and ready.
