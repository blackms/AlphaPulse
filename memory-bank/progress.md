   - ‚úÖ System API tests (GET /api/v1/system)

2. **WebSocket Tests**
   - ‚úÖ WebSocket connection tests for all channels (metrics, alerts, portfolio, trades)
   - ‚úÖ Authentication tests for WebSocket connections
   - ‚úÖ Message broadcasting tests
   - ‚úÖ Disconnection handling tests

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - ‚úÖ Shared fixtures for authentication, users, and common data
   - ‚úÖ Test script for running API tests with various options
   - ‚úÖ Integration with pytest for test discovery and execution

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**
   - Run tests and fix any issues
   - Add integration tests with actual database
   - Implement performance benchmarks

2. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation with Swagger UI
   - Document authentication and authorization flow
   - Create usage examples for frontend developers

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Implement connection pooling for database access
   - Add health checks and monitoring for the API itself

## Dashboard Frontend (Task 1.5)

### Status: Planning Complete ‚úÖ

The design for the Dashboard Frontend has been completed and documented in `dashboard_frontend_design.md` and `frontend_architecture.md`. Implementation will begin after the Dashboard Backend is fully tested and ready.

## Overall Project Status

|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 Monitoring System | ‚úÖ Complete | Implemented metrics collection, storage, and calculations |
| 1.2 Alerting System | ‚úÖ Complete | Implemented alert rules, evaluation, and notifications |
| 1.3 Integration | ‚úÖ Complete | Integrated monitoring and alerting systems |
| 1.4 Dashboard Backend | ‚úÖ Complete | Integrated with alerting system, all tests passing |
| 1.5 Dashboard Frontend | üìù Planned | Design complete, implementation pending |

### Morning: Dashboard Backend - Alerting System Integration Planning

Based on code exploration, we've discovered that the Dashboard Backend implementation is more advanced than initially estimated. The system has:

1. A complete FastAPI application structure with:
   - REST API endpoints for metrics, alerts, portfolio, and trades
   - WebSocket server for real-time updates
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Data access layer

2. The primary remaining task is integrating our newly implemented alerting system with the Dashboard Backend:
   - Connect alert data accessor to the new alerting system
   - Update WebSocket alert notifications to use the new alerting system
   - Create integration tests for the alerting system and Dashboard Backend

3. A revised integration plan has been documented in `dashboard_integration_plan.md` and `dashboard_backend_status.md`.

### Afternoon: Dashboard Backend - Alerting System Integration Implementation

We have successfully completed the integration of our alerting system with the Dashboard Backend:

1. **AlertDataAccessor Integration**:
   - Updated `AlertDataAccessor` to use our new alerting system's storage
   - Implemented proper alert formatting for API responses
   - Added support for filtering and acknowledgment

2. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Created a new `AlertsSubscription` class to connect to our alerting system
   - Implemented real-time alert broadcasting to WebSocket clients
   - Added a `WebNotificationChannel` to our alerting system

3. **API Startup Integration**:
   - Updated the FastAPI application startup to initialize our alerting system
   - Connected the AlertManager to the SubscriptionManager
   - Ensured proper shutdown of all components

4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive integration tests for the alerting system and API
   - Added a demo script to showcase the integration
   - Documented the integration in `alerting_api_integration.md`

Next steps: Begin work on the Dashboard Frontend implementation (Task 1.5).

### Dashboard Frontend Implementation Planning

With the Dashboard Backend now complete, we have shifted our focus to planning the Dashboard Frontend implementation (Task 1.5):

1. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Created a comprehensive implementation plan in `dashboard_frontend_implementation_plan.md`
   - Defined technology stack (React, TypeScript, Redux, Material UI)
   - Outlined component structure and data flow
   - Created implementation phases and timeline
   - Established UI design guidelines

2. **Project Structure**:
   - Designed a detailed project structure in `dashboard_frontend_project_structure.md`
   - Created template files for core application components
   - Defined directory organization
   - Prepared setup instructions

Next steps: Continue implementation of the Dashboard Frontend according to the plan, moving to Phase 2 (Dashboard Page and Core Components).
