2025-04-07 02:21:08 - Initial creation of Memory Bank.

* Implemented the long/short trading strategy for S&P 500

## Completed Tasks

* Set up the basic project structure with necessary modules (data_manager.py, backtester.py, agents)
* Implemented the DataManager for fetching and preparing data from various sources
* Implemented the Backtester for simulating trades based on agent signals
* Implemented the base agent class and specialized agents (technical, fundamental, sentiment)
* Created configuration files for the backtest
* Executed initial backtest with technical and sentiment agents
* Generated trade history and performance metrics

## Completed Tasks
+* Analyzed poor walk-forward backtest results for Long/Short strategy (2025-04-07)
+* Implemented Phase 1 of Walk-Forward Improvement Plan (Trailing Stop, Optimize Weights, Increase Trials) (2025-04-07)
+
+## Current Tasks
+
+* (Moved from Next Steps) Re-run walk-forward analysis with Phase 1 improvements.
+* (Moved from Next Steps) Analyze new walk-forward results and evaluate Phase 1 impact.
+
+## Next Steps (Post Phase 2 Evaluation)
+
+* If necessary: Review optimization objective (Phase 3).
+* If necessary: Refine signal logic (Phase 3).
+* Enable and test the fundamental agent to see if it improves performance
* Implement additional technical indicators for the technical agent
* Improve the sentiment analysis to better capture market sentiment
* Extend the backtest to a longer time period (2010-2023)
* Enable validation features (walk-forward analysis, Monte Carlo simulations)
* Compare performance against benchmark strategies
* Generate more detailed performance reports and visualizations
