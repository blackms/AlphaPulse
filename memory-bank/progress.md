# Progress Tracking

## Completed Tasks

### 2025-03-08: Refactored Exchange Synchronizer Module

- ✅ Analyzed the monolithic exchange_synchronizer.py file (>1000 lines)
- ✅ Designed a modular structure following SOLID principles
- ✅ Created a new sync_module package with focused components:
  - ✅ types.py: Data types and enums
  - ✅ exchange_manager.py: Exchange creation and initialization
  - ✅ data_sync.py: Data synchronization with exchanges
  - ✅ task_manager.py: Task management and scheduling
  - ✅ event_loop_manager.py: Event loop management
  - ✅ synchronizer.py: Main orchestrator class
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Updated memory bank with decisions
- ✅ Fixed import issues in dependent modules (system.py)
- ✅ Verified functionality with the API running correctly

### 2025-03-08: Fixed Bybit API Authentication Issue

- ✅ Identified the issue with Bybit API authentication
- ✅ Implemented custom signature generation for Bybit V5 API
- ✅ Added account type handling (UNIFIED as default)
- ✅ Enhanced ExchangeFactory to support extra options
- ✅ Created diagnostic tool (debug_bybit_connection.py)
- ✅ Verified fix with successful API connections

### 2025-03-08: Improved Event Loop Management

- ✅ Identified issues with event loops in multi-threaded environment
- ✅ Enhanced EventLoopManager with new methods:
  - ✅ run_coroutine_in_new_loop: Runs coroutines in isolated event loops
- ✅ Updated TaskManager to handle event loop issues:
  - ✅ Made update_sync_status more resilient
  - ✅ Added fallback mechanisms for database operations
- ✅ Enhanced ExchangeDataSynchronizer to handle event loop issues:
  - ✅ Improved error handling in _sync_exchange_data
  - ✅ Added better logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Tested changes with the API running correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Create Unit Tests for New Module Structure**
   - Create test cases for each component
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Verify backward compatibility
   - Test event loop management in multi-threaded environment

2. **Further Improve Event Loop Management**
   - Implement thread-local event loop storage
   - Add more robust error recovery mechanisms
   - Consider using a dedicated event loop per thread
   - Add metrics for event loop performance

3. **Add Telemetry and Monitoring**
   - Add performance metrics collection
   - Track synchronization success rates
   - Monitor API call latency
   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting

4. **Enhance Error Recovery**
   - Implement more sophisticated circuit breaker patterns
   - Add automatic recovery mechanisms
   - Improve error reporting
   - Add retry strategies with exponential backoff

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update API documentation
   - Create usage examples
   - Document troubleshooting steps
   - Add architecture diagrams
