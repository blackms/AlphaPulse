# Long/Short Trading Strategy Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a long/short trading strategy on the S&P 500 with weekly or monthly rebalancing. The strategy combines trend-following, mean reversion, and optional ML signals to decide whether to be long, short, or neutral in each period.

## 2. Strategy Components

### 2.1 Data Handling

#### 2.1.1 Data Sources
- **Primary Data**: S&P 500 index (^GSPC) or SPY ETF daily OHLCV data
- **Volatility Data**: VIX index for volatility regime detection
- **Economic Data**: Optional FRED data for economic indicators

#### 2.1.2 Data Processing
- Fetch daily data from Yahoo Finance or FRED API
- Resample to weekly or monthly timeframes
- Handle missing data and ensure proper alignment
- Create a unified DataFrame with all necessary data

### 2.2 Indicator Calculation

#### 2.2.1 Trend/Momentum Indicators
- 40-week Moving Average (MA_40w)
- 12-week Rate of Change (momentum_12w)
- Optional: MACD or other trend indicators

#### 2.2.2 Mean Reversion Indicators
- 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI_14)
- Optional: Bollinger Bands or other oscillators

#### 2.2.3 Volatility/Regime Indicators
- VIX index as a proxy for market fear/volatility
- Optional: ATR (Average True Range) for S&P 500

#### 2.2.4 Optional ML Model
- Feature engineering from technical indicators
- Target variable: future 1-week or 1-month return sign
- Model: Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Output: Probability of upward movement (p_up)

### 2.3 Signal Generation

#### 2.3.1 Trend-Following Signal
- Long (+1) when price > MA_40w
- Short (-1) when price < MA_40w

#### 2.3.2 Mean Reversion Adjustment
- Reduce long bias (-0.5) when RSI > 70 (overbought)
- Reduce short bias (+0.5) when RSI < 30 (oversold)

#### 2.3.3 Volatility-Based Adjustment
- Reduce position size when VIX > threshold (e.g., 30)
- Optional: Exit positions when VIX > extreme threshold (e.g., 40)

#### 2.3.4 Optional ML Signal
- Add +0.5 to signal when p_up > 0.5
- Add -0.5 to signal when p_up < 0.5

#### 2.3.5 Composite Signal
- Combine all signals with appropriate weights
- Clip final signal to range [-1, +1]

### 2.4 Position Sizing & Execution

#### 2.4.1 Position Direction
- Long when final_signal > 0
- Short when final_signal < 0
- Flat (cash) when final_signal = 0

#### 2.4.2 Position Size
- Base size: 100% of capital
- Adjusted size: base_size * abs(final_signal)
- Optional: Volatility targeting for risk parity

#### 2.4.3 Execution Rules
- Rebalance at end of week or month
- Enter new positions when signal changes
- Adjust position size based on signal strength

### 2.5 Risk Management

#### 2.5.1 Stop-Loss Rules
- Fixed percentage stop-loss (e.g., 8% from entry)
- Optional: Trailing stop as profit increases

#### 2.5.2 Drawdown Control
- Reduce position size when drawdown > threshold (e.g., 15%)
- Exit all positions when drawdown > max threshold (e.g., 25%)

#### 2.5.3 Exposure Limits
- Maximum leverage: 1.0 (no leverage)
- Maximum position size: 100% of capital
