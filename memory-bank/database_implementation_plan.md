## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical path for this implementation is:

1. Database configuration (1.3) → ORM models (2.1) → Repository implementation (2.3) → Integration (3.x) → Testing (4.x) → Deployment (5.x)

Key dependencies:
- TimescaleDB setup must be completed before time-series data management
- Repository pattern implementation must be completed before component integration
- Redis setup must be completed before WebSocket integration
- All integration must be complete before performance testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each repository method
- Test ORM model operations
- Test connection management
- Test caching operations

### Integration Testing
- Test data flow between components
- Test transaction management
- Test error handling and recovery

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark query performance
- Measure database throughput
- Test with large datasets
- Identify bottlenecks

### Load Testing
- Simulate high-load scenarios
- Test connection pooling under load
- Measure response times under load
- Test recovery from high-load situations

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | High | Early performance testing, optimize queries, proper indexing |
| Integration delays | Medium | Medium | Regular integration tests, clear interfaces, modular design |
| Schema changes breaking existing code | Medium | High | Proper migration system, backward compatibility, versioned APIs |
| Production deployment issues | Low | High | Thorough testing in staging, automated deployment, rollback plan |
