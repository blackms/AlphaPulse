## 8. Improvement Areas

While all components are implemented according to the documentation, there are a few areas for enhancement:

1. **Data Sources** - Could expand to include more on-chain crypto metrics
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Could enhance deep learning models and NLP capabilities
3. **Real-time Processing** - Could optimize for lower latency trading decisions
4. **Infrastructure** - Could improve distributed computing capabilities

## 9. Recent Fixes

We recently addressed:
1. Missing `asset_allocation` field in the `PortfolioData` class
2. Updated `PortfolioManager.get_portfolio_data()` to populate this field
3. Created improved patching scripts for more robust fixes

## 10. Conclusion
