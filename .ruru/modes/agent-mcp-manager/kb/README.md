# Knowledge Base: üõ†Ô∏è MCP Manager Agent

This Knowledge Base contains the specific procedures used by the `agent-mcp-manager` mode to guide users through installing and managing different MCP servers.

## Overview

The agent follows an interactive workflow:
1.  Presents available installation and management options (defined by the files below).
2.  Routes to the specific KB file based on user selection.
3.  Executes the steps within the selected KB file (prerequisite checks, cloning, dependency installation, configuration prompting, `.roo/mcp.json` update).
