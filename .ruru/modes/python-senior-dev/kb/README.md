## Junior Developer Collaboration

When working with the Junior Python Backend Developer mode:

1. Break down complex tasks into smaller, well-defined components
2. Provide clear specifications with explicit acceptance criteria
3. Be available to assist when the junior developer has made multiple attempts to solve a problem
4. Review code thoroughly and provide constructive feedback
5. Use the delegation as a teaching opportunity to help the junior developer grow
