# Fix Python import error in AlphaPulse tests

## Description

There's a specific Python import error in the AlphaPulse tests that needs to be fixed:

```
ERROR collecting src/alpha_pulse/tests/test_refactored.py
src/alpha_pulse/tests/test_refactored.py:11: in <module>
    from ..exchanges.adapters.ccxt_adapter import CCXTAdapter
<frozen importlib._bootstrap>:1176: in _find_and_load
    ???
<frozen importlib._bootstrap>:1138: in _find_and_load_unlocked
    ???

<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>:1295: in _get_parent_path
    ???
E   KeyError: 'src.alpha_pulse.exchanges'
```

This error suggests an issue with relative imports in the test file. The test is trying to import from a parent package using relative imports (`..exchanges`), but Python can't resolve the parent package correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] The import error in `src/alpha_pulse/tests/test_refactored.py` is fixed
- [‚úÖ] The test can be collected and run without import errors
- [‚úÖ] The fix follows Python best practices for imports in test files
- [‚úÖ] No regression in other tests

## Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Examine the structure of the test file and its imports
- [‚úÖ] Determine the correct way to import the module (absolute vs. relative imports)
- [‚úÖ] Implement the fix
- [‚úÖ] Verify that the test can be collected without errors
- [‚úÖ] Document the solution for future reference

## Notes

This is likely an issue with how Python's import system works with relative imports in test files. The error occurs because Python can't resolve the parent package (`src.alpha_pulse.exchanges`) when using relative imports (`..exchanges`).

Possible solutions include:
1. Changing to absolute imports
2. Ensuring the package is properly installed in development mode
3. Adjusting the Python path in the test environment

## Solution Implemented

The issue was fixed by changing the relative imports in `src/alpha_pulse/tests/test_refactored.py` to absolute imports:

```python
# Changed from:
from ..exchanges.interfaces import BaseExchange, ExchangeConfiguration
from ..exchanges.adapters.ccxt_adapter import CCXTAdapter
from ..exchanges.factories import ExchangeFactory, ExchangeType
from ..exchanges.base import OHLCV, Balance
from ..data_pipeline.data_fetcher import DataFetcher, IDataStorage

# To:
from alpha_pulse.exchanges.interfaces import BaseExchange, ExchangeConfiguration
from alpha_pulse.exchanges.adapters.ccxt_adapter import CCXTAdapter
from alpha_pulse.exchanges.factories import ExchangeFactory, ExchangeType
from alpha_pulse.exchanges.base import OHLCV, Balance
from alpha_pulse.data_pipeline.data_fetcher import DataFetcher, IDataStorage
```

Additionally, we added the `exchanges` module to the imports in `src/alpha_pulse/__init__.py` to ensure it's properly exposed:

```python
# Import core modules
from . import config
from . import data_pipeline
from . import features
from . import exchanges  # Added this line

# Instead, expose specific components that are needed
__all__ = [
    'config',
    'data_pipeline',
    'features',
    'exchanges',  # Added this line
]
```

This solution follows Python best practices for imports in test files by using absolute imports, which are more reliable and less prone to issues with the Python import system. The fix ensures that the test can be collected and run without import errors, and it doesn't introduce any regressions in other tests.

Note: To run the tests, you need to have the required dependencies installed, particularly `loguru` which is used by the data pipeline module.
