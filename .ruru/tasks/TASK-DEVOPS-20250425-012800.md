# Implement conda-based TA-Lib installation in CI environment

## Description

We're still encountering the TA-Lib undefined symbol error in the CI environment. The previous solution was designed but not fully implemented in the CI workflow. We need to implement the conda-based solution that was proposed in the previous task.

The error is still the same:

```
ImportError: /usr/share/miniconda/envs/test-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/talib/_ta_lib.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: TA_AVGDEV_Lookback
```

The solution that was proposed but not yet implemented involves using conda to install both the C library and Python wrapper from conda-forge.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] The conda-based TA-Lib installation solution is implemented in the CI workflow
- [‚úÖ] The TA-Lib C library and Python wrapper are installed from conda-forge
- [‚úÖ] The Python ta-lib package can be imported without undefined symbol errors
- [‚úÖ] Tests can access the ta-lib package
- [‚úÖ] CI build completes without ta-lib-related errors
- [‚úÖ] Solution is documented for future reference

## Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Update the GitHub Actions workflow to use conda to install TA-Lib
- [‚úÖ] Replace the current GitHub Actions workflow with the updated version that was created in the previous task
- [‚úÖ] Add verification steps to ensure the TA-Lib package can be imported without errors
- [‚úÖ] Test the solution to ensure it works consistently
- [‚úÖ] Update the documentation with the implemented solution

## Notes

The solution was already designed in the previous task (TASK-DEVOPS-20250425-011300) but not fully implemented in the CI workflow. The key steps are:

1. Use conda to install both the C library and Python wrapper from conda-forge:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install TA-Lib with conda
     run: |
       conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib
   ```

2. Verify that the installation works by importing the package and testing a specific function:
   ```yaml
   - name: Verify TA-Lib installation
     run: |
       python -c "import talib; print(talib.AVGDEV([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2))"
   ```

The updated GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app-updated.yml`) was created in the previous task but needs to be implemented as the active workflow.
