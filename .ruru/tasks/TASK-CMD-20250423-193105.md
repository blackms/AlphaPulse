# Task: Coordinate fixing failing test test_get_trades_forbidden in test_trades_api.py

## Objective
Ensure the failing test `test_get_trades_forbidden` in `src/alpha_pulse/tests/api/test_trades_api.py` is fixed.

## Plan
1. Create an MDTM task file for the `dev-fixer` mode.
2. Delegate the test fixing task to the `dev-fixer` mode using the MDTM workflow, referencing the task file.
3. Monitor the `dev-fixer` task progress.
4. Confirm the specific test is passing upon completion.
