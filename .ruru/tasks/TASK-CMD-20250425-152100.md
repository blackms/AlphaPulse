# Task: Fix GitHub Actions TA-Lib ImportError

## 1. Description

The user reported a GitHub Actions build failure indicated by an `ImportError: undefined symbol: TA_AVGDEV_Lookback` when importing `talib`. Analysis revealed a version mismatch between the TA-Lib C library installed from source (v0.4.0) in the workflow and the Python wrapper required by `pyproject.toml` (`^0.6.3`).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`) is modified to install a compatible TA-Lib C library version.
*   The build passes the "Verify dependencies" step without the `ImportError`.
*   The user confirms the fix resolves the issue (implicitly by the build passing).

## 3. Log / Updates

*   **2025-04-25 15:21:** Received user request with image of failed build. Analyzed error and identified TA-Lib version mismatch as the likely cause.
*   **2025-04-25 15:21:** Delegated task to `code` mode (Task ID pending assignment in `code` mode's context) to modify `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` to use `apt-get install libta-lib-dev` instead of building from source. Waiting for `code` mode to complete the modification.

## 4. Checklist

*   [ ] Delegate workflow modification to `code` mode. (Done)
*   [ ] Monitor `code` mode task completion.
*   [ ] Verify the changes made by `code` mode.
*   [ ] Inform user of the fix and suggest triggering a new build.
