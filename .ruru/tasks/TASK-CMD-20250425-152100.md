# Task: Fix GitHub Actions TA-Lib ImportError

## 1. Description

The user reported a GitHub Actions build failure indicated by an `ImportError: undefined symbol: TA_AVGDEV_Lookback` when importing `talib`. Analysis revealed a version mismatch between the TA-Lib C library installed from source (v0.4.0) in the workflow and the Python wrapper required by `pyproject.toml` (`^0.6.3`).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`) is modified to install a compatible TA-Lib C library version.
*   The build passes the "Verify dependencies" step without the `ImportError`.
*   The user confirms the fix resolves the issue (implicitly by the build passing).

## 3. Log / Updates

*   **2025-04-25 15:21:** Received user request with image of failed build. Analyzed error and identified TA-Lib version mismatch as the likely cause.
*   **2025-04-25 15:21:** Delegated task to `code` mode (Task ID pending assignment in `code` mode's context) to modify `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` to use `apt-get install libta-lib-dev` instead of building from source. Waiting for `code` mode to complete the modification.
*   **2025-04-25 15:24:** Received confirmation (via file read) that `code` mode successfully modified `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`.
*   **2025-04-25 15:26:** User reported build failed again. Error: `E: Unable to locate package libta-lib-dev`. This indicates the package repository might need to be enabled.
*   **2025-04-25 15:26:** Planning to delegate to `code` mode again to add `sudo add-apt-repository universe` before the `apt-get update` command in the workflow.

## 4. Checklist

*   [x] Delegate workflow modification to `code` mode (Attempt 1 - apt install). (Done)
*   [x] Monitor `code` mode task completion. (Done)
*   [x] Verify the changes made by `code` mode. (Done)
*   [x] Inform user of the fix and suggest triggering a new build. (Failed - Package not found, Attempt 1)
*   [x] Delegate workflow modification to `code` mode (Attempt 2 - add repo). (Done)
*   [x] Monitor `code` mode task completion. (Done)
*   [x] Verify the changes made by `code` mode. (Done)
*   [ ] Inform user of the fix and suggest triggering a new build. (Failed - Package still not found, Attempt 2)
*   **2025-04-25 15:42:** User reported build failed again with the same error. Planning to add `software-properties-common` installation before adding the repository.
*   [x] Delegate workflow modification to `code` mode (Attempt 3 - add software-properties-common). (Done)
*   [x] Monitor `code` mode task completion. (Done)
*   [x] Verify the changes made by `code` mode. (Done)
*   [ ] Inform user of the fix and suggest triggering a new build. (Failed - Package still not found, Attempt 3)
*   **2025-04-25 15:49:** User reported build failed again with the same error. The package `libta-lib-dev` cannot be located even with `universe` enabled and `software-properties-common` installed. Planning to modify the workflow to search for available ta-lib packages using `apt-cache search`.
*   [x] Delegate workflow modification to `code` mode (Attempt 4 - apt-cache search). (Done)
*   [x] Monitor `code` mode task completion. (Done)
*   [x] Verify the changes made by `code` mode. (Done)
*   [ ] Analyze search results from the next build log. (Not applicable - Build failed during poetry install as C lib was missing)
*   [ ] Delegate further fix based on search results.
*   [ ] Inform user of the fix and suggest triggering a new build. (Failed - C headers missing, Attempt 4)
*   **2025-04-25 16:19:** User reported build failed during `poetry install` with `fatal error: ta-lib/ta_defs.h: No such file or directory`. This confirms the C library wasn't installed by the search step. Reverting to building from source, but using latest stable version (0.4.28).
*   [x] Delegate workflow modification to `code` mode (Attempt 5 - Build 0.4.28 from source). (Done)
*   [x] Monitor `code` mode task completion. (Done - Assumed complete based on interruption/resumption)
*   [ ] Verify the changes made by `code` mode. (Skipping direct verification, will rely on build outcome)
*   **2025-04-25 16:25:** User requested build monitoring via `gh` CLI. Delegating to `lead-devops`.
*   [x] Delegate build monitoring to `lead-devops`. (Done)
*   [x] Receive build status report from `lead-devops`. (Done - Failed: 404 on wget for 0.4.28 source)
*   [x] Inform user of the final build outcome. (Failed - Incorrect download URL, Attempt 5)
*   **2025-04-25 16:27:** User provided direct links for TA-Lib 0.6.4 `.deb` package and source. Planning to use the `.deb` package for installation.
*   [x] Delegate workflow modification to `code` mode (Attempt 6 - Install 0.6.4 .deb). (Done)
*   [x] Monitor `code` mode task completion. (Done)
*   [x] Verify the changes made by `code` mode. (Done)
*   [x] Delegate build monitoring to `lead-devops`. (Done)
*   [x] Receive build status report from `lead-devops`. (Done - Failed during pytest, exit code 2)
*   [x] Inform user of the final build outcome. (Failed - Pytest failures, Attempt 6)
*   **2025-04-25 16:49:** `lead-devops` reported build failed during "Test with pytest" step (exit code 2). TA-Lib installation likely succeeded, but tests are failing. Delegating log retrieval to `lead-devops`.
*   [x] Delegate pytest log retrieval to `lead-devops`. (Done)
*   [x] Receive pytest logs from `lead-devops`. (Done - Logs show ModuleNotFoundErrors)
*   [x] Analyze pytest failures (or delegate analysis). (Done - Missing `psutil`, `langchain`, `asyncpg`)
*   **2025-04-25 16:51:** Planning to add missing dependencies (`psutil`, `langchain`, `asyncpg`) to `pyproject.toml`.
*   [x] Delegate `pyproject.toml` modification to `code` mode (Add psutil, langchain, asyncpg). (Done)
*   [x] Monitor `code` mode task completion. (Done - Interrupted)
*   [ ] Verify the changes made by `code` mode. (Skipping - Build failed with new error)
