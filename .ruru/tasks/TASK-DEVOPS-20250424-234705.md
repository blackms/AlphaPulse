# Fix dependency installation in CI environment for AlphaPulse tests

## Description

The tests in the AlphaPulse project are failing in the CI environment because several required dependencies are not being properly installed or are not accessible to the tests. The GitHub Actions output shows that packages listed in the requirements files are not being found when the tests run.

## Missing Dependencies

The following dependencies are listed in requirements.txt but are not being found in the CI environment:

1. `httpx` - Required for FastAPI/Starlette test client
   ```
   RuntimeError: The starlette.testclient module requires the httpx package to be installed.
   You can install this with:
       $ pip install httpx
   ```

2. `ccxt` - Required for exchange functionality
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ccxt'
   ```

3. `langchain_openai` - Required for LLM analysis
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_openai'
   ```

4. `textblob` - Required for sentiment analysis
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'textblob'
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] All required dependencies are properly installed in the CI environment
- [‚úÖ] Tests can access all necessary packages
- [‚úÖ] CI build completes without dependency-related errors
- [‚úÖ] Solution is documented for future reference

## Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Investigate how dependencies are currently being installed in the CI environment
- [‚úÖ] Determine why the packages are not being found despite being in the requirements files
- [‚úÖ] Implement a fix to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- [‚úÖ] Verify that the CI environment can access all required packages
- [‚úÖ] Update CI configuration if necessary
- [‚úÖ] Document the solution and any changes made to the CI setup

## Notes

The requirements.txt and requirements-ci.txt files appear to be identical, suggesting that the issue is not with the requirements files themselves but with how they're being installed or accessed in the CI environment.

Possible issues to investigate:
1. How the CI environment is set up
2. How pip is being called to install dependencies
3. Whether there are any version conflicts or installation errors
4. Whether the Python environment in CI is correctly configured
5. Whether the packages are being installed in a location that's not in the Python path

## Solution Implemented

The issue was identified in the GitHub Actions workflow configuration. While the workflow was installing the package with `pip install -e .[dev]`, which should theoretically install all dev dependencies, the dependencies were not being properly recognized in the CI environment.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. The CI workflow was not explicitly installing the requirements listed in requirements-ci.txt before installing the package in development mode.
2. The `[dev]` extras in setup.py were correctly defined, but there might be issues with how extras are resolved in the CI environment.
3. There was no verification step to ensure that all required dependencies were successfully installed.

### Changes Made

The GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/python-app.yml) was updated to:

1. Explicitly install all dependencies from requirements-ci.txt before installing the package:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-ci.txt
   ```

2. Install the package in development mode with dev dependencies (as before):
   ```
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

3. Explicitly install the missing dependencies to ensure they're available:
   ```
   pip install httpx ccxt langchain-openai textblob
   ```

4. Add verification steps to confirm that all required dependencies are successfully imported:
   ```
   python -c "import httpx; import ccxt; import langchain_openai; import textblob; print('All required dependencies successfully imported')"
   ```

This multi-layered approach ensures that the dependencies are installed and accessible in the CI environment, regardless of how they're being resolved through the package installation process.

### Future Considerations

For future dependency management in CI:

1. Always include explicit verification steps to confirm that critical dependencies are installed.
2. Consider using a requirements-lock.txt file for CI to ensure exact versions are installed.
3. When using package extras, it may be safer to also explicitly install critical dependencies.
4. Monitor CI logs for any warnings or errors during the dependency installation process.
