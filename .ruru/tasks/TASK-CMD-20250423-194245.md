# Task: Coordinate fixing failing tests in test_trades_api.py

## Objective
Ensure all failing tests in the file `src/alpha_pulse/tests/api/test_trades_api.py` are fixed.

## Plan
1. Create an MDTM task file for the `dev-fixer` mode.
2. Delegate the test fixing task to the `dev-fixer` mode using the MDTM workflow, referencing the task file.
3. Monitor the `dev-fixer` task progress.
4. Confirm all tests in the file are passing upon completion.
