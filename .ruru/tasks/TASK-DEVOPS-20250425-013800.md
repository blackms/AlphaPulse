# Fix TA-Lib conda package not found error in CI environment

## Description

We're encountering a new issue with the conda installation of TA-Lib in the CI environment. The package `ta-lib=0.4.0` is not available from the current conda channels:

```
Run echo "===== Installing TA-Lib using conda ====="
===== Installing TA-Lib using conda =====
Channels:
 - conda-forge
 - defaults
Platform: linux-64
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): ...working... done
Solving environment: ...working... failed

PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

  - ta-lib=0.4.0

Current channels:

  - https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge
  - defaults
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r
```

We need to fix this issue by either finding the correct package name/version in conda-forge or using an alternative approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] The TA-Lib package is successfully installed in the CI environment
- [‚úÖ] The Python ta-lib package can be imported without undefined symbol errors
- [‚úÖ] Tests can access the ta-lib package
- [‚úÖ] CI build completes without ta-lib-related errors
- [‚úÖ] Solution is documented for future reference

## Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Investigate the correct package name/version for TA-Lib in conda-forge
- [‚úÖ] Update the GitHub Actions workflow with the correct installation approach (switched to Poetry)
- [‚úÖ] If conda installation is not possible, implement the fallback solution (building from source)
- [‚úÖ] Add verification steps to ensure the TA-Lib package can be imported without errors
- [‚úÖ] Test the solution to ensure it works consistently
- [‚úÖ] Update the documentation with the implemented solution

## Implementation Notes

After investigating the issue, we decided to switch from conda to Poetry for managing Python dependencies. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **Updated pyproject.toml**:
   - Changed the build system from setuptools to poetry-core
   - Added all required dependencies including ta-lib

2. **Updated GitHub Actions workflow**:
   - Replaced conda setup with Poetry setup
   - Kept the TA-Lib C library installation from source
   - Added Poetry-based installation for Python dependencies
   - Updated verification steps to use Poetry

3. **Created documentation**:
   - Added a new file `docs/TA_LIB_INSTALLATION.md` with detailed instructions
   - Documented the solution for future reference

The solution ensures that:
- The TA-Lib C library is properly installed from source
- The Python wrapper is installed via Poetry
- All dependencies are managed consistently
- Verification steps confirm the installation works correctly

This approach is more reliable than using conda because:
- It gives us more control over the installation process
- Poetry provides better dependency resolution
- Building the C library from source ensures compatibility
- The solution is well-documented for future maintenance
