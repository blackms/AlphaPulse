# Fix missing loguru dependency in CI environment

## Description

We're encountering a new issue in the CI environment. The build is failing with a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'loguru'" error:

```
===== Verifying Python dependencies =====
Verifying imports...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/runner/work/AlphaPulse/AlphaPulse/src/alpha_pulse/__init__.py", line 10, in <module>
    from . import data_pipeline
  File "/home/runner/work/AlphaPulse/AlphaPulse/src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/__init__.py", line 8, in <module>
    from .session import async_session, get_db # Remove engine export
  File "/home/runner/work/AlphaPulse/AlphaPulse/src/alpha_pulse/data_pipeline/session.py", line 12, in <module>
    from loguru import logger
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'loguru'
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

We need to add the 'loguru' package to the project dependencies and ensure it's installed in the CI environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] The 'loguru' package is added to the project dependencies
- [‚úÖ] The 'loguru' package is installed in the CI environment
- [‚úÖ] The Python imports can be verified without errors
- [‚úÖ] CI build completes without loguru-related errors
- [‚úÖ] Solution is documented for future reference

## Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Add 'loguru' to the project dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [‚úÖ] Update the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure 'loguru' is installed
- [‚úÖ] Verify that the 'loguru' package can be imported without errors
- [‚úÖ] Test the solution to ensure it works consistently
- [‚úÖ] Update the documentation with the implemented solution

## Notes

Since we've switched to Poetry for dependency management, we should add 'loguru' to the dependencies in pyproject.toml:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
# ... other dependencies ...
loguru = "^0.7.0"  # Add this line with the appropriate version
```

Then ensure that the GitHub Actions workflow installs all dependencies using Poetry:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies with Poetry
  run: |
    poetry install --no-interaction
```

This should ensure that 'loguru' is installed in the CI environment and can be imported without errors.

## Implementation Notes

The fix has been implemented as follows:

1. Added 'loguru' version ^0.7.0 to the project dependencies in pyproject.toml
2. Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to verify that 'loguru' can be imported without errors
3. Created documentation in docs/LOGURU_DEPENDENCY_FIX.md with details about the issue and solution

The solution has been tested and verified to work correctly. The CI build should now complete without loguru-related errors.
