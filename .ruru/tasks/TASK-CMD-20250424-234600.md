# Coordinate fixing of failing tests in AlphaPulse project

## Description

This task is to coordinate the fixing of failing tests in the AlphaPulse project. The tests are failing in the CI environment due to missing dependencies and import issues.

## Delegated Tasks

I've delegated the following tasks to specialists:

1. **QA Lead** - Overall test fixing coordination:
   - Task ID: `TASK-QA-20250424-234630`
   - Status: 🟢 Done
   - Responsible for overall coordination of test fixes

2. **Python Developer** - Fix import error:
   - Task ID: `TASK-PYDEV-20250424-234645`
   - Status: 🟢 Done
   - Responsible for fixing the Python import error in test_refactored.py

3. **DevOps Lead** - Fix CI environment dependency issues:
   - Task ID: `TASK-DEVOPS-20250424-234705`
   - Status: 🟢 Done
   - Responsible for ensuring dependencies are properly installed in the CI environment

## Acceptance Criteria

- [✅] All delegated tasks are completed successfully
- [✅] All tests pass in the CI environment
- [✅] No regression in test coverage
- [✅] Solutions are documented for future reference

## Coordination Log

- **2025-04-24 23:46:00** - Analyzed test failures from GitHub Actions output
- **2025-04-24 23:46:30** - Created and delegated task to QA Lead
- **2025-04-24 23:46:45** - Created and delegated task to Python Developer
- **2025-04-24 23:47:05** - Created and delegated task to DevOps Lead
- **2025-04-24 23:47:25** - Created coordination task to track progress
- **2025-04-24 23:56:51** - Delegated task to QA Lead
- **2025-04-25 00:02:43** - Delegated task to Python Developer
- **2025-04-25 00:05:16** - Delegated task to DevOps Lead
- **2025-04-25 00:05:30** - Received completion reports from all specialists

## Summary of Solutions

1. **QA Lead** coordinated the overall test fixing effort and verified that all issues were resolved.

2. **Python Developer** fixed the import error by:
   - Changing relative imports to absolute imports in `src/alpha_pulse/tests/test_refactored.py`
   - Adding the `exchanges` module to the imports in `src/alpha_pulse/__init__.py` to ensure it's properly exposed

3. **DevOps Lead** fixed the dependency installation issues by:
   - Updating the GitHub Actions workflow to explicitly install all dependencies from requirements-ci.txt
   - Installing the package in development mode with dev dependencies (`pip install -e .[dev]`)
   - Adding explicit installation steps for the missing dependencies
   - Adding verification steps to confirm successful imports

## Notes

All issues have been successfully resolved:

1. The missing dependencies (httpx, ccxt, langchain_openai, textblob) are now properly installed in the CI environment.
2. The import error in test_refactored.py has been fixed by using absolute imports instead of relative imports.
3. All tests now pass successfully in the CI environment.
4. Solutions have been documented for future reference.

This task is now complete.
