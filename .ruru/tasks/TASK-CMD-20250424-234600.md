# Coordinate fixing of failing tests in AlphaPulse project

## Description

This task is to coordinate the fixing of failing tests in the AlphaPulse project. The tests are failing in the CI environment due to missing dependencies and import issues. After fixing the initial issues, we discovered an additional problem with the TA-Lib C library not being installed in the CI environment.

## Delegated Tasks

I've delegated the following tasks to specialists:

1. **QA Lead** - Overall test fixing coordination:
   - Task ID: `TASK-QA-20250424-234630`
   - Status: 🟢 Done
   - Responsible for overall coordination of test fixes

2. **Python Developer** - Fix import error:
   - Task ID: `TASK-PYDEV-20250424-234645`
   - Status: 🟢 Done
   - Responsible for fixing the Python import error in test_refactored.py

3. **DevOps Lead** - Fix CI environment dependency issues:
   - Task ID: `TASK-DEVOPS-20250424-234705`
   - Status: 🟢 Done
   - Responsible for ensuring Python dependencies are properly installed in the CI environment

4. **DevOps Lead** - Fix TA-Lib installation in CI (first attempt):
   - Task ID: `TASK-DEVOPS-20250425-001600`
   - Status: 🟢 Done
   - Responsible for installing the TA-Lib C library in the CI environment

5. **DevOps Lead** - Fix TA-Lib installation in CI (continued):
   - Task ID: `TASK-DEVOPS-20250425-004100`
   - Status: 🟢 Done
   - Responsible for resolving the continued TA-Lib installation issues in the CI environment

## Acceptance Criteria

- [✅] All delegated tasks are completed successfully
- [✅] All tests pass in the CI environment
- [✅] No regression in test coverage
- [✅] Solutions are documented for future reference

## Summary of Solutions

1. **QA Lead** coordinated the overall test fixing effort and verified that all issues were resolved.

2. **Python Developer** fixed the import error by:
   - Changing relative imports to absolute imports in `src/alpha_pulse/tests/test_refactored.py`
   - Adding the `exchanges` module to the imports in `src/alpha_pulse/__init__.py` to ensure it's properly exposed

3. **DevOps Lead** fixed the dependency installation issues by:
   - Updating the GitHub Actions workflow to explicitly install all dependencies from requirements-ci.txt
   - Installing the package in development mode with dev dependencies (`pip install -e .[dev]`)
   - Adding explicit installation steps for the missing dependencies
   - Adding verification steps to confirm successful imports

## Final Summary of Solutions

1. **QA Lead** coordinated the overall test fixing effort and verified that all issues were resolved.

2. **Python Developer** fixed the import error by:
   - Changing relative imports to absolute imports in `src/alpha_pulse/tests/test_refactored.py`
   - Adding the `exchanges` module to the imports in `src/alpha_pulse/__init__.py` to ensure it's properly exposed

3. **DevOps Lead** fixed the Python dependency installation issues by:
   - Updating the GitHub Actions workflow to explicitly install all dependencies from requirements-ci.txt
   - Installing the package in development mode with dev dependencies (`pip install -e .[dev]`)
   - Adding explicit installation steps for the missing dependencies
   - Adding verification steps to confirm successful imports

4. **DevOps Lead** attempted to fix the TA-Lib installation issue by:
   - Updating the GitHub Actions workflow to install the TA-Lib C library before installing Python dependencies
   - Creating comprehensive documentation in `docs/TA_LIB_INSTALLATION.md` explaining TA-Lib installation for different platforms
   - Adding verification steps to ensure the library is properly installed

5. **DevOps Lead** successfully fixed the TA-Lib installation issue with a more robust solution:
   - Enhanced the GitHub Actions workflow with detailed logging at each step
   - Updated the linker cache with `sudo ldconfig` after installation
   - Set environment variables (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH`) to help the compiler and linker find the library
   - Added symbolic link creation from `libta_lib.so` to `libta-lib.so` for compatibility
   - Added multiple verification steps to confirm the library is installed and accessible
   - Implemented multiple installation methods for the Python package
   - Updated documentation with enhanced installation procedures and troubleshooting guidance

## Notes

All issues have been successfully resolved:

1. The missing Python dependencies (httpx, ccxt, langchain_openai, textblob) are now properly installed in the CI environment.
2. The import error in test_refactored.py has been fixed by using absolute imports instead of relative imports.
3. The TA-Lib C library is now properly installed in the CI environment, allowing the Python ta-lib package to build successfully.
4. All tests now pass successfully in the CI environment.
5. Solutions have been documented for future reference, including enhanced documentation for TA-Lib installation with troubleshooting guidance.

This task is now complete.
