# Resolve python-multipart version conflict in CI

## Description

The GitHub Actions CI workflow is failing during the `Install dependencies with Poetry` step due to a version conflict with the recently added `python-multipart` dependency. The error message indicates that the specified version (`^0.7.0`) does not match any compatible versions with other dependencies.

The task is to identify and resolve this version conflict to allow Poetry to successfully install all dependencies and enable the CI workflow to proceed and pass.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The `python-multipart` dependency is correctly specified in `pyproject.toml` to resolve the conflict.
*   `poetry install` runs successfully in the GitHub Actions CI workflow.
*   All tests pass in the GitHub Actions CI workflow.
*   The GitHub Actions CI workflow completes without errors.

## Checklist

- [ ] Analyze the `pyproject.toml` file and the CI error logs to identify the conflicting dependency that prevents `python-multipart (^0.7.0)` from being installed.
- [ ] Research compatible versions or version ranges for `python-multipart` that satisfy all dependency constraints.
- [ ] Update the `python-multipart` version specification in `pyproject.toml` with a compatible version or range.
- [ ] Run `poetry lock` locally to update the `poetry.lock` file with the resolved dependencies.
- [ ] Commit the changes to `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
- [ ] Push the changes to the repository to trigger a new CI workflow run.
- [ ] Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow run using the `gh run watch` command or the GitHub UI.
- [ ] If the workflow fails again, analyze the new error logs and repeat the process (analyze, update, commit, push, monitor) until the CI workflow passes.
- [ ] Report successful CI workflow run using `attempt_completion`.
