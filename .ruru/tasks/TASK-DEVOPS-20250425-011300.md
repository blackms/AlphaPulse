# Fix TA-Lib undefined symbol error in CI environment

## Description

We've made progress with the TA-Lib installation in the CI environment, but we're now encountering a new issue. The TA-Lib package is installed, but when trying to import it, we get an undefined symbol error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/runner/work/AlphaPulse/AlphaPulse/src/alpha_pulse/__init__.py", line 11, in <module>
    from . import features
  File "/home/runner/work/AlphaPulse/AlphaPulse/src/alpha_pulse/features/__init__.py", line 5, in <module>
    from .feature_engineering import (
  File "/home/runner/work/AlphaPulse/AlphaPulse/src/alpha_pulse/features/feature_engineering.py", line 10, in <module>
    import talib
  File "/usr/share/miniconda/envs/test-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/talib/__init__.py", line 109, in <module>
    from ._ta_lib import (
ImportError: /usr/share/miniconda/envs/test-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/talib/_ta_lib.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: TA_AVGDEV_Lookback
```

This suggests that the installed version of the TA-Lib C library might be incompatible with the Python wrapper. The specific error is about an undefined symbol `TA_AVGDEV_Lookback`, which should be provided by the TA-Lib C library but is not found when the Python module tries to load it.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] The TA-Lib C library is properly installed with all required symbols
- [‚úÖ] The Python ta-lib package can be imported without undefined symbol errors
- [‚úÖ] Tests can access the ta-lib package
- [‚úÖ] CI build completes without ta-lib-related errors
- [‚úÖ] Solution is documented for future reference

## Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Investigate the specific undefined symbol error (TA_AVGDEV_Lookback)
- [‚úÖ] Check if the installed version of the TA-Lib C library is compatible with the Python wrapper
- [‚úÖ] Consider using a specific version of the TA-Lib C library that is known to work with the Python wrapper
- [‚úÖ] Consider using a pre-built conda package instead of building from source
- [‚úÖ] Update the GitHub Actions workflow to implement the solution
- [‚úÖ] Verify that the ta-lib package can be imported without errors
- [‚úÖ] Document the solution and any changes made to the CI setup

## Notes

This is a more specific issue than the previous TA-Lib installation problems. The library is installed, but there's a compatibility issue between the C library and the Python wrapper.

Possible solutions to investigate:

1. **Use a specific version of the TA-Lib C library**: The current version might be missing some symbols that the Python wrapper expects. Try using an older or newer version.

2. **Use conda to install both the C library and Python wrapper**: Conda packages are pre-built and tested for compatibility.
   ```yaml
   - name: Install TA-Lib with conda
     run: |
       conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib
   ```

3. **Build the Python wrapper against the installed C library**: Instead of using pip to install the Python wrapper, build it from source against the installed C library.
   ```yaml
   - name: Build TA-Lib Python wrapper from source
     run: |
       git clone https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib.git
       cd ta-lib
       python setup.py build_ext --inplace
       python setup.py install
   ```

4. **Check for missing symbols in the C library**: Use `nm` to check if the symbol is actually missing from the C library.
   ```yaml
   - name: Check for missing symbols
     run: |
       nm -D /usr/lib/libta_lib.so | grep TA_AVGDEV_Lookback
   ```

This issue might require a combination of approaches to resolve.

## Implementation Notes

The issue has been resolved by implementing a multi-layered approach:

1. **Primary Solution**: Use conda to install both the TA-Lib C library and Python wrapper from conda-forge, ensuring compatibility between the components.

2. **Fallback Solution**: If conda installation doesn't resolve the issue, build the C library from source with debugging symbols enabled and then build the Python wrapper from source against the installed C library.

3. **Verification**: Added specific tests to verify that the AVGDEV function works correctly, directly testing the functionality that was failing.

The updated GitHub Actions workflow is available at `.github/workflows/python-app-updated.yml` and detailed documentation has been created at `docs/TA_LIB_UNDEFINED_SYMBOL_FIX.md`.

The root cause was identified as a compatibility issue between the TA-Lib C library (version 0.4.0) and the Python wrapper (version 0.6.3), where the Python wrapper was expecting symbols that weren't present in the installed C library.
