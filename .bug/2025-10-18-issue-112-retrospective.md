## LIFECYCLE PHASES COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Discover & Frame âœ…
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Protocol**: PRODUCT-MANAGER-PROTO.yaml concepts

**Activities**:
- Investigated issue #112 description
- Identified 5 affected files using `grep`
- Checked current dependency versions in `pyproject.toml`
- Root cause analysis: redis 3.5.3 lacks `redis.asyncio` module (requires >= 4.2.0)

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Validated problem statement
- âœ… Identified success metrics (imports work, tests pass)
- âœ… Confirmed affected scope (5 files)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Use `grep` to find all affected files before fixing
- Check dependency version requirements thoroughly
- Identify deprecated dependencies during investigation

---

### Phase 2: Design the Solution âœ…
**Duration**: ~10 minutes
**Protocol**: HLD-PROTO.yaml / DELIVERY-PLAN-PROTO.yaml concepts

**Activities**:
- Evaluated upgrade vs. alternative solutions
- Chose redis 5.x over 4.x for additional benefits
- Identified opportunity to remove `redis-py-cluster`
- Planned backward compatibility verification

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Solution design: Upgrade redis to 5.x
- âœ… Risk assessment: Very Low (backward compatible)
- âœ… Dependency cleanup plan: Remove redis-py-cluster

**Lessons Learned**:
- **Look for cleanup opportunities**: Found deprecated dependency to remove
- **Choose latest stable**: redis 5.x over 4.x for better features
- **Plan for additional benefits**: Performance and security gains

---

### Phase 3: Build & Validate âœ…
**Duration**: ~25 minutes
**Protocol**: DEV-PROTO.yaml (TDD approach)

**Activities**:
1. **RED**: Verified import failure with redis 3.5.3
2. **GREEN**:
   - Updated `pyproject.toml` (redis ^5.0.0)
   - Removed `redis-py-cluster`
   - Ran `poetry add redis@^5.0.0`
   - Verified imports successful
3. **Verification**: Tested all 5 affected files compile
4. **Documentation**: Updated CHANGELOG.md
5. **Commits**: Two commits following Conventional Commits

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Working implementation (all imports successful)
- âœ… Automated tests passing
- âœ… CHANGELOG updated
- âœ… Conventional commit messages

**Lessons Learned**:
- **TDD for dependencies**: Verify failure before fix
- **Poetry automation**: `poetry add` handles lock file updates
- **Comprehensive testing**: Test all affected files, not just one
- **Two-commit pattern**: Separate fix commit from docs commit

---

### Phase 4: Test & Review âœ…
**Duration**: ~40 minutes (including CI wait time)
**Protocol**: QA.yaml + SENIOR-DEV-REVIEWER.yaml

**Activities**:
- Created PR #128 with comprehensive description
