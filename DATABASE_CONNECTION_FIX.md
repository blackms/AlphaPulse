# Database Connection Fix for AlphaPulse Data Pipeline

## Problem Summary

The AlphaPulse data pipeline synchronizer was encountering multiple connection-related errors during Bybit exchange synchronization:

1. **InterfaceError: "cannot perform operation: another operation is in progress"**
   - Occurs when trying to execute a database operation while another operation is already in progress on the same connection

2. **Task got Future attached to a different loop**
   - Indicates asyncio tasks from one event loop tried to interact with another event loop
   - Common in multi-threaded async applications with improper isolation

3. **ConnectionDoesNotExistError: connection was closed in the middle of operation**
   - Database connection was terminated unexpectedly during an active operation

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Improper Connection Pooling**: Connections weren't properly isolated between threads and event loops
2. **Insufficient Transaction Management**: Transactions weren't consistently managed across all operations
3. **Inadequate Error Handling**: No robust retry mechanism for transient connection issues
4. **Event Loop Confusion**: Tasks created in one event loop attempting to run in another
5. **Thread Safety Issues**: Thread identifiers weren't consistently tracked across modules

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Connection Manager
- Created connection pools per thread/event loop combination
- Implemented proper connection acquisition and release
- Added transaction management with automatic commit/rollback
- Developed robust error handling and retry logic

### 2. Task Manager Improvements
- Added consistent thread and event loop tracking
- Implemented consistent logging with proper context identifiers
- Enhanced error handling with proper status updates

### 3. Synchronizer Enhancements
- Improved isolation between different data type sync operations
- Better handling of concurrent operations
- More robust error management for sync operations
- Proper tracking of partial success in ALL sync operations

### 4. Consistent Thread/Loop Identification
- Implemented `get_loop_thread_key()` across all modules
- Ensured consistent logging format with proper context

## Testing

1. Run the test_bybit_sync.py script to verify connection pooling and transaction management:
   ```bash
   python test_bybit_sync.py
   ```

2. This test will verify:
   - Multiple concurrent operations are handled correctly
   - Connection pooling works properly across threads and loops
   - Retry logic handles transient errors
   - Connections remain stable throughout sync operations

## Key Code Improvements

1. **Connection Pooling**:
   ```python
   async def get_connection_pool():
       """Get or create a connection pool for the current event loop and thread."""
       loop_thread_key = get_loop_thread_key()
       
       # Check if we already have a pool for this combination
       if loop_thread_key in _connection_pools:
           pool = _connection_pools[loop_thread_key]
           if not pool.is_closed():
               return pool
   ```

2. **Transaction Management**:
   ```python
   @asynccontextmanager
   async def get_db_connection():
       """Get a database connection with transaction management."""
       conn = None
       tr = None
       
       try:
           # Acquire a connection with retry logic
           conn = await execute_with_retry(acquire_connection)
           
           # Start a transaction
           tr = conn.transaction()
           await tr.start()
           
           yield conn
           
           # If we get here, commit the transaction
           await tr.commit()
       except Exception:
           # If an exception occurs, rollback the transaction
           if tr and not tr._done:
               await tr.rollback()
           raise
   ```

3. **Retry Logic**:
   ```python
   async def execute_with_retry(operation, max_retries=MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS):
       """Execute a database operation with retry logic."""
       retry_count = 0
       
       while retry_count < max_retries:
           try:
               return await operation()
           except (asyncpg.InterfaceError, asyncpg.ConnectionDoesNotExistError) as e:
               # Handle connection errors with retry
               retry_count += 1
               if retry_count < max_retries:
                   # Calculate backoff time with jitter
                   backoff = BASE_RETRY_DELAY * (2 ** (retry_count - 1)) + random.uniform(0, 0.5)
                   # Reset the connection pool as needed
                   # Wait and retry
               else:
                   raise
   ```

4. **Improved ALL Sync Operation**:
   ```python
   # Sync each data type individually with proper isolation
   async def sync_balances_op():
       repo = await get_repository()
       await self._data_synchronizer.sync_balances(exchange_id, exchange, repo)
       return True
   
   balances_success = await execute_with_retry(sync_balances_op)
   
   # Track partial success
   sync_success = balances_success or positions_success or orders_success or prices_success
   ```

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Add additional logging for database connection lifecycle events
2. Monitor transaction durations and implement timeouts for long-running operations
3. Set up alerts for repeated connection failures
4. Implement more detailed metrics for connection pool usage and health

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing database connection health checks
2. Add circuit breaker pattern for external API calls that might impact database operations
3. Implement more granular retry policies based on error types
4. Consider database read replicas for heavy read operations
