# Database Connection Fix for AlphaPulse Data Pipeline

## Problem Summary

The AlphaPulse data pipeline synchronizer module was experiencing database connection issues during sync operations for the Bybit exchange. The logs showed several critical errors:

1. `InterfaceError: cannot perform operation: another operation is in progress`
2. `Task got Future attached to a different loop`
3. `ConnectionDoesNotExistError: connection was closed in the middle of operation`

These errors indicated problems with:
- Concurrent database operations
- Event loop conflicts in asyncio
- Database connections being closed unexpectedly during operations

## Root Causes

After analyzing the code, we identified the following root causes:

1. **Global Connection Pool**: The system was using a single global connection pool (`_pg_pool`) shared across all threads without proper synchronization.

2. **Event Loop Conflicts**: Multiple threads were trying to use the same event loop, causing conflicts when tasks were attached to different loops.

3. **Lack of Connection Retry Logic**: There was no mechanism to retry database operations when connections failed or were closed unexpectedly.

4. **Improper Transaction Management**: Database transactions weren't properly managed, leading to connections being left in an inconsistent state.

5. **Fallback to Direct Connections**: When asyncio issues occurred, the code fell back to direct psycopg2 connections, creating additional connection management problems.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Thread-Local Connection Pools

- Replaced the global `_pg_pool` with thread-local storage for connection pools
- Each thread now has its own dedicated connection pool
- Added proper synchronization for pool creation with a lock

```python
# Thread-local storage for connection pools
_thread_local = threading.local()

# Lock for pool creation
_pool_creation_lock = threading.Lock()

async def _get_thread_pg_pool() -> asyncpg.Pool:
    """Get or create a PostgreSQL connection pool for the current thread."""
    # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Connection Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for database operations
- Implemented jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Added specific handling for different types of connection errors

```python
async def _execute_with_retry(operation, max_retries=MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS):
    """Execute a database operation with retry logic."""
    # Implementation details...
```

### 3. Improved Transaction Management

- Ensured each database operation is wrapped in a transaction
- Added proper transaction commit/rollback handling
- Ensured connections are always released back to the pool, even on errors

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def get_pg_connection():
    """Get a PostgreSQL connection from the thread-local pool with retry logic."""
    # Implementation with transaction management...
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added specific handling for different types of database errors
- Improved logging with thread IDs for better debugging
- Added connection pool reset on connection errors

### 5. Connection Pool Configuration Improvements

- Increased minimum and maximum pool sizes
- Added command timeout and statement timeout settings
- Limited connection lifetime to prevent stale connections
- Added maximum queries per connection to prevent resource exhaustion

```python
_thread_local.pg_pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    # Connection parameters...
    min_size=2,           # Ensure we have at least 2 connections
    max_size=20,          # Increased from 10 to handle more concurrent operations
    command_timeout=60.0, # Set command timeout to 60 seconds
    max_inactive_connection_lifetime=300.0,  # 5 minutes max idle time
    max_queries=50000,    # Maximum queries per connection
    setup=lambda conn: conn.execute('SET statement_timeout = 30000;')  # 30 second statement timeout
)
```

### 6. Proper Connection Cleanup

- Added a `close_all_connections()` function to ensure proper cleanup
- Ensured connections are closed when threads exit
- Added connection cleanup in error handling paths

```python
async def close_all_connections():
    """Close all database connections."""
    # Implementation details...
```

## Testing

A test script (`test_database_connection.py`) has been created to verify the fixes:

1. It runs multiple workers concurrently in the same thread to test connection pooling
2. It runs workers in multiple threads to test thread-local connection pools
3. It performs a mix of read and write operations to test transaction management
4. It verifies that the system can handle concurrent operations without errors

To run the test:

```bash
python test_database_connection.py
```

## Conclusion

These changes significantly improve the robustness of the database connection handling in the AlphaPulse data pipeline. The system now:

1. Properly handles concurrent database operations
2. Manages event loop conflicts between threads
3. Automatically retries failed operations with exponential backoff
4. Ensures proper transaction management and connection cleanup
5. Provides better logging and error reporting for debugging

These improvements should eliminate the "another operation is in progress" and "connection was closed" errors, ensuring stable database connections during synchronization tasks.
